I N T E R S T E L L A R

01:13.657 --> 01:16.203
My dad was a farmer.

01:17.098 --> 01:20.270
Like everybody else back then.

01:21.926 --> 01:24.125
Of course he didn't
start that way.

01:29.453 --> 01:31.607
The computer says
you're too tight.

01:31.716 --> 01:34.568
No, I got this!
- Crossing the Straits.

01:37.345 --> 01:39.226
I've got to shut it down Cooper.
- Heyyy.

01:40.543 --> 01:43.279
Shutting all down... -Hey, we do
not have to shut down anything!

01:47.279 --> 01:48.339
Dad?

01:53.771 --> 01:57.747
Sorry Murph. Go
back to bed babe.

01:57.900 --> 01:59.458
I thought you were the ghost.

02:02.017 --> 02:06.082
There's no such thing as a ghost babe.
- Grandpa says that you can get ghosts.

02:07.349 --> 02:09.854
No, that's because grandpa
is too close to...

02:09.969 --> 02:12.530
being one himself.
Go back to bed.

02:12.716 --> 02:14.577
Were you dreaming
about the crash?

02:15.875 --> 02:18.465
Get your butt back in bed Murph.

02:44.531 --> 02:47.068
The wheat had died.

02:47.179 --> 02:51.224
The blight came and we had to burn it.
We still had corn.

02:51.304 --> 02:56.141
We had acres of corn.
But mostly we had dust.

02:58.680 --> 03:01.317
I guess I can't describe it.
It was just constant.

03:01.428 --> 03:05.801
Just that, steady blow of dirt.

03:07.279 --> 03:10.245
We wore little
strips of sheet...

03:10.362 --> 03:15.312
sometimes over our nose and mouth.
So we wouldn't breathe so much of it.

03:17.290 --> 03:21.216
Well when we set the table we
always set the plate upside down.

03:21.367 --> 03:23.938
Glasses or cups, whatever
it was, upside down.

03:29.482 --> 03:33.569
Shake a leg. Murph, get your move on.
- One o'clock today, you and me...

03:33.570 --> 03:37.146
in the barn, Herbicide
Resistance 101, check? -Yes sir.

03:38.841 --> 03:40.059
Not at the table Murph!

03:41.081 --> 03:42.761
Dad, can you fix this?

03:44.164 --> 03:47.189
What the heck did you do to my lander?
- It wasn't me.

03:47.268 --> 03:50.945
Let me guess. It was your ghost.
- It knocked it off my shelf.

03:51.019 --> 03:53.819
It also knocks the books off. -There's
no such thing as ghosts dumbass.

03:53.866 --> 03:56.030
Hey. -I looked it up, it's
called a poltergeist.

03:56.109 --> 03:59.740
Dad, tell her. -Well, that's
not very scientific Murph.

03:59.853 --> 04:03.637
You said that science was about admitting
what we don't know. -She's got you there.

04:03.750 --> 04:05.841
Hey, start looking
after all our stuff.

04:07.500 --> 04:08.580
Coop.

04:10.852 --> 04:13.373
Alright Murph, you
wanna talk science?

04:13.913 --> 04:17.846
Don't just tell me that you're afraid of
some ghost. No, you gotta go further.

04:17.959 --> 04:20.079
You have to record the
facts, analyze...

04:20.188 --> 04:24.391
get to the how and the why and
present your conclusions. Deal?

04:24.504 --> 04:26.765
Deal. -All right!

04:28.626 --> 04:31.292
Have a good day at school.
- Hold up.

04:31.364 --> 04:35.636
Parent-Teacher conferences,
parent, not grandparent.

04:38.510 --> 04:42.625
Slow down turbo. That's
not a dust storm.

04:42.731 --> 04:45.708
Nelson's torching his whole crop.
- Blight?

04:45.828 --> 04:50.364
They're saying it's the last
harvest for okra. Ever.

04:52.249 --> 04:54.770
He should have planted
corn like the rest of

04:54.782 --> 04:57.147
us. -Now you be nice
to that Miss Hanley.

04:57.260 --> 04:59.603
She's single. -Well what's
that supposed to mean?

04:59.713 --> 05:02.977
Repopulating the Earth. -Start
pulling your weight young man.

05:03.053 --> 05:07.176
Why don't you start minding
your own business? Old man!

05:14.284 --> 05:15.767
All right Murph give me second.

05:17.298 --> 05:20.771
Aha,....thirrrd.

05:21.781 --> 05:25.707
Find a gear dumbass. -Grind it!
- Shut it Tom!

05:26.611 --> 05:29.504
Whatcha do Murph? -Ahh,
she didn't do nothing.

05:29.587 --> 05:33.172
Blew a tire is all. -Murphy's Law.
- Shut up!

05:33.253 --> 05:36.076
Grab the spare Tom.
- That is the spare.

05:36.185 --> 05:39.278
Get the patch kit.

05:40.765 --> 05:42.895
And how am I supposed
to patch it out here?

05:42.968 --> 05:46.372
You'll have to figure it out. I'm not
always gonna be here to help you.

05:53.874 --> 05:56.767
What's goin' on Murph?

05:56.842 --> 06:01.567
Why did you and mom name me after
something that's bad? -No we didn't?

06:01.641 --> 06:03.473
Murphy's Law?

06:04.847 --> 06:07.721
Murphy's Law doesn't mean
that something bad...

06:07.831 --> 06:10.637
will happen. What it means
is whatever can happen...

06:10.638 --> 06:14.346
will happen. And that
sounded just fine with us.

06:20.293 --> 06:22.131
Get in.

06:23.612 --> 06:24.838
Get in, let's go.

06:26.216 --> 06:28.701
What about the flat tire?

06:31.347 --> 06:32.347
Yes.

06:46.437 --> 06:51.208
It is an Indian Air Force drone. Solar
cells could power an entire farm.

06:51.320 --> 06:52.320
Take the wheel Tom.

06:57.482 --> 07:00.366
Go, go go!

07:00.455 --> 07:02.075
Keep it pointed at that.

07:10.073 --> 07:13.007
Faster Tom, we're losing it.
- Yes.

07:13.085 --> 07:14.956
Point right at it.

07:16.219 --> 07:20.361
Hang on, here we go, here we go.

07:28.433 --> 07:30.405
Nice driving Tom.

07:37.050 --> 07:41.280
Dad? -Almost got it,
don't stop, don't stop.

07:41.389 --> 07:44.332
Dad?! Tom!!!

07:49.112 --> 07:51.092
Wha..? You told me
to keep driving.

07:52.533 --> 07:56.566
Well I guess that answers the ol' 'if I
ask you to drive off a cliff' scenario.

07:59.344 --> 08:02.662
We lost it. -No we didn't!

08:14.414 --> 08:17.010
Wanna give it a whirl?

08:31.871 --> 08:35.400
Let's land it down there, right
at the edge of the reservoir.

08:39.465 --> 08:41.082
Nicely done!

08:43.200 --> 08:45.975
How long do you think
it's been up there?

08:46.053 --> 08:49.925
Delhi Mission Control went down
same as ours, 10 years ago.

08:51.299 --> 08:52.701
So for 10 years?

08:55.615 --> 08:58.354
Why'd it come down so low?
- I don't know.

08:58.466 --> 09:02.604
Maybe the sun cooked it's brain or
it was looking for something. -What?

09:02.717 --> 09:06.150
Give me that large flat blade
Maybe some kind of signal.

09:06.259 --> 09:07.441
I don't know.

09:12.532 --> 09:14.073
What are you gonna do with it?

09:14.153 --> 09:18.009
I'm gonna give it something
socially responsible to do...

09:18.044 --> 09:22.574
like driving a combine.
- Can't we just, let it go?

09:24.151 --> 09:26.027
It wasn't hurting anybody.

09:28.079 --> 09:32.172
Listen, this thing needs to learn how
to adapt Murph, like the rest of us.

09:36.351 --> 09:39.989
So how's this work? Do you guys come with?
- I've got class.

09:40.067 --> 09:42.554
This one, needs to wait.

09:42.627 --> 09:46.782
What did you do? -They'll tell you
about it when you get in there.

09:46.859 --> 09:49.353
Well am I gonna be mad?
- Not with me.

09:49.462 --> 09:50.756
Just please, try not to.

09:50.872 --> 09:54.766
Hey, relax....I got this.

09:59.253 --> 10:02.647
You're late Coop.
- Yeah, we had a flat.

10:02.717 --> 10:06.684
And I guess you had to stop off
at Asian fighter plane store.

10:06.793 --> 10:10.034
No actually sir, that's a,
that's a surveillance drone.

10:10.144 --> 10:13.947
With outstanding solar cells.
It's Indian. -Take a seat.

10:15.535 --> 10:20.241
So, we got Tom's scores back.

10:20.352 --> 10:25.074
He's gonna make an excellent farmer.
- Yeah he's got a knack for it.

10:25.183 --> 10:26.448
What about college?

10:26.566 --> 10:30.808
Well the university only takes a handful.
They don't really have the resources.

10:30.880 --> 10:35.800
- I still pay my taxes. Where does that
money go? There's no more armies.

10:35.911 --> 10:37.802
Well, they don't go
to the university.

10:38.924 --> 10:40.655
Look Coop, you have
to be realistic.

10:40.766 --> 10:45.133
You're ruling my son out for college now?
The kid's 15.

10:45.279 --> 10:49.788
Tom's score simply isn't high enough.
- What's your waistline?

10:49.860 --> 10:54.650
How about 32, about 33 inseam? -I'm not
sure I see where you're getting at.

10:54.760 --> 10:56.896
You're telling me it takes two
numbers to measure your own ass...

10:56.897 --> 10:59.348
but only one to
measure my son's future?

10:59.420 --> 11:03.058
Come on, you're a
well-educated man Coop...

11:03.170 --> 11:05.407
and a trained pilot.
- And an engineer.

11:05.442 --> 11:10.264
Okay well right now, we
don't need more engineers.

11:10.298 --> 11:15.341
We didn't run out of television screens
or planes; we ran out of food!

11:15.453 --> 11:19.813
The world needs farmers. Good
farmers like you, and Tom.

11:20.004 --> 11:24.652
Uneducated farmers. -We are a
caretaker generation Coop.

11:24.771 --> 11:28.473
And things are getting better. Maybe
your grandkids will get to be...

11:28.474 --> 11:29.474
-Are we done here sir?

11:30.465 --> 11:34.678
No. Miss Hanley is here
to talk about Murph.

11:34.754 --> 11:37.301
Murph is a great kid,
she's really bright. But

11:37.313 --> 11:39.655
she's been having a
little trouble lately.

11:39.728 --> 11:41.718
She brought this in
to show the other

11:41.730 --> 11:44.100
students. The section
on the lunar landings.

11:44.176 --> 11:48.631
Yeah, it's one of my old textbooks.
She always loved the pictures.

11:48.715 --> 11:52.633
It's an old federal textbook. We've
replaced them with the corrected versions.

11:52.710 --> 11:57.477
Corrected? -Explaining how the Apollo
missions were faked to bankrupt...

11:57.512 --> 11:58.669
the Soviet Union.

12:04.030 --> 12:07.187
You don't believe we
went to the Moon?

12:07.298 --> 12:09.653
I believe it was a brilliant
piece of propaganda

12:09.665 --> 12:11.693
that the Soviets
bankrupted themselves...

12:11.728 --> 12:15.328
pouring resources into rockets
and other useless machines.

12:15.436 --> 12:16.876
Useless machines?

12:16.985 --> 12:20.864
And if we don't want a repeat of the excess
and wastefulness of the 20th century...

12:20.899 --> 12:24.721
then we need to teach our kids about
this planet. Not tales of leaving it.

12:24.830 --> 12:29.421
You know one of those useless machines
they used to make was called an MRI.

12:29.531 --> 12:33.033
And if we had any of those left, the
doctors would've been able to find...

12:33.108 --> 12:37.064
the cyst in my wife's brain before
she died; instead of afterwards.

12:37.136 --> 12:39.083
And then she would have
been the one sitting

12:39.095 --> 12:40.837
here listening to
this instead of me...

12:40.917 --> 12:45.604
which would've been a good thing because
she was always the... the calmer one.

12:45.868 --> 12:48.851
I'm sorry about your wife Mr.
Cooper.

12:49.039 --> 12:53.404
But Murph got into a fistfight
with several of her classmates...

12:53.405 --> 12:55.809
over this Apollo nonsense.

12:55.844 --> 12:58.955
So we thought it would be best to bring you
in and see what ideas you might have...

12:58.990 --> 13:01.765
for dealing with her
behavior on the home front.

13:01.872 --> 13:05.536
Yeah, you know what, there's
a game tomorrow night.

13:05.691 --> 13:09.419
She's going through a bit of a baseball
phase, her favorite team is playing.

13:09.532 --> 13:11.089
There's gonna be
candy and soda...

13:13.995 --> 13:16.976
I think I'll take her to that.

13:21.182 --> 13:25.980
How'd it go? -I got
you suspended.

13:26.090 --> 13:28.247
What?? -Cooper.

13:29.323 --> 13:33.925
This is Cooper, go. -Coop, those
combines you rebuilt went haywire.

13:34.004 --> 13:38.651
Just reset the controllers. -I did
that, but you should come take a look.

13:58.978 --> 14:01.758
One by one they just teared off
the fields and headed over.

14:01.870 --> 14:04.573
Something's interfering
with the compass.

14:04.687 --> 14:08.134
Magnetism. Or somethin' such.

14:50.789 --> 14:55.003
There's nothing special about which book.
I've been working on it, like you said.

14:55.073 --> 14:58.344
I counted the spaces. -Why?

14:59.897 --> 15:04.834
In case the ghost is trying to communicate.
I'm trying Morse.

15:04.911 --> 15:09.624
Morse? -Yeah, dots and dashes.
It's...

15:09.696 --> 15:12.020
I know what Morse code is Murph.
But I still don't think your...

15:12.034 --> 15:14.222
bookshelf is trying
to talk to you.

15:25.678 --> 15:30.104
Had to reset every compass clock
and GPS to offset off the anomaly.

15:30.257 --> 15:33.015
Which is? -I don't know.

15:34.632 --> 15:36.850
Now if the house had been
built on magnetic ore...

15:36.923 --> 15:39.730
we would have seen this the first
time we switched on the tractor.

15:41.866 --> 15:45.694
I hear your meeting at the
school didn't go so well.

15:47.211 --> 15:52.182
You heard? It's like we've
forgotten who we are, Donald.

15:54.055 --> 15:57.145
Explorers, pioneers,
not caretakers.

15:59.745 --> 16:03.882
When I was a kid, it felt like
they made something new everyday.

16:03.994 --> 16:07.121
Some gadget or idea.

16:07.231 --> 16:11.875
Like every day was Christmas.
But 6, billion people,

16:11.946 --> 16:13.864
Just try to imagine that.

16:14.432 --> 16:18.219
And every last one of them
trying to have it all.

16:20.810 --> 16:23.178
This world isn't so bad.

16:26.246 --> 16:29.548
And Tom will do just fine. You're
the one who doesn't belong.

16:29.623 --> 16:32.318
Born 40 years too late
or 40 years too early.

16:33.254 --> 16:35.779
My daughter knew it.
God bless her.

16:37.112 --> 16:39.664
And your kids know it,
especially Murph.

16:39.773 --> 16:43.086
Ahh we used to look up
to the sky and wonder...

16:43.895 --> 16:46.483
at our place in the stars.

16:48.831 --> 16:50.774
Now we just look down,

16:50.883 --> 16:53.847
and worry about our
place in the dirt.

16:53.955 --> 16:56.397
Cooper, you were
good at something,

16:56.475 --> 17:00.071
and you never got a chance
to do anything with it.

17:00.180 --> 17:01.906
I'm sorry.

17:03.351 --> 17:07.320
You didn't expect this dirt that
was giving you this food...

17:07.402 --> 17:11.222
to turn on you like
that and destroy you.

17:11.302 --> 17:16.212
In April I believe if I'm right,
15th of April I, I think.

17:16.247 --> 17:20.671
This just happened at about 1:30 when that
thing came off the top of the canyon.

17:20.746 --> 17:26.025
In my day we had real ball players.
Who're these bums?

17:26.135 --> 17:28.835
Well in my day, people
were too busy...

17:28.921 --> 17:31.247
fighting over food
to even play baseball.

17:31.282 --> 17:36.149
Popcorn at a ball game is unnatural.
I want a hot dog.

17:36.224 --> 17:38.567
School says you're gonna
follow in my footsteps.

17:39.615 --> 17:42.679
I think that's great.
You think that's great?

17:42.792 --> 17:46.570
You hate farming dad.
Grandpa said.

17:46.678 --> 17:51.320
Grandpa said huh? Listen, all that
matters is how you feel about it.

17:51.465 --> 17:55.573
I like what you do.
I like our farm.

17:55.723 --> 17:57.706
And you're gonna be great at it.

18:10.585 --> 18:12.134
Let's get outta here.

18:19.961 --> 18:24.138
All right it's a doozy.
Alright gang, lets mask up.

18:27.489 --> 18:29.255
Tom, Murph? -Check. -Check?

19:22.986 --> 19:25.198
Murph, Tom, you guys
shut your windows?

19:29.208 --> 19:30.543
Murph.

19:51.269 --> 19:56.117
The ghost. -Grab your pillow.

19:56.226 --> 19:58.570
You're sleeping with Tom.

20:53.218 --> 20:55.336
It's not a ghost.

21:00.656 --> 21:01.990
It's gravity.

21:03.907 --> 21:06.483
I'm dropping Tom, then
heading into town.

21:06.596 --> 21:10.917
You wanna clean that up? When
you've finished praying to it.

21:36.327 --> 21:38.917
It's not Morse
Murph, it's binary.

21:39.029 --> 21:41.441
Thick is 1, thin is 0.

21:45.185 --> 21:46.734
Coordinates.

22:00.028 --> 22:04.911
That's it. -I can't miss this.

22:05.025 --> 22:07.572
Grandpa will be back in a
couple of hours Murph.

22:08.664 --> 22:10.627
But you don't know what
you're gonna find.

22:11.542 --> 22:16.542
And that, is why I
can't take you.

22:22.382 --> 22:23.671
Murph?

22:24.798 --> 22:29.081
Grandpa will be home in a while,
tell him I'll call him on the radio.

22:36.236 --> 22:39.195
Jesus! What're you doing?

22:39.305 --> 22:41.909
Oh do you think it's funny? Huh?

22:41.983 --> 22:44.814
You wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for me.

22:46.794 --> 22:49.231
Make yourself useful.

23:52.203 --> 23:53.253
Hey Murph.

23:54.300 --> 23:55.952
Murph.

23:59.628 --> 24:01.857
I think this is the
end of the road.

24:04.264 --> 24:06.357
Didn't you bring
the bolt cutters?

24:08.234 --> 24:09.604
That's my girl.

24:36.200 --> 24:40.617
Step away from the fence. -Don't
shoot, don't shoot. I'm unarmed.

24:40.724 --> 24:41.981
My daughter is in the car.

24:46.631 --> 24:49.223
Don't be afraid.

25:01.938 --> 25:06.150
How did you find this place?
- Where is my daughter?

25:06.264 --> 25:08.358
You had the coordinates
for this facility marked

25:08.370 --> 25:10.518
on your map. Where did you
get those coordinates?

25:10.876 --> 25:14.378
Where is my daughter?! -Don't make
me take you down again, sit down!

25:14.486 --> 25:17.434
Oh do you still think
you're a Marine pal?

25:17.545 --> 25:19.848
Marines don't exist.
And you know what?

25:19.956 --> 25:23.662
I've got grunts like
you mowing my grass.

25:23.736 --> 25:25.849
Where did you find those coordinates?
- Unless

25:25.861 --> 25:27.848
you wanna end up as my
second lawnmower...

25:28.498 --> 25:32.721
no, I think I'll turn you into a valve
of a vacuum or a dry cleaner. No you won't.

25:34.101 --> 25:36.686
TARS, back down please.

25:37.947 --> 25:41.018
You're taking a risk using
ex-military security.

25:41.136 --> 25:45.202
They are old and their control
units are unpredictable.

25:45.315 --> 25:47.219
It's what the
government could spare.

25:48.776 --> 25:51.815
Who are you? -Dr. Brand.

25:51.926 --> 25:56.785
Yeah I knew a Dr. Brand once, he was a
Professor. -What makes you think I'm not?

25:56.894 --> 25:58.494
Wasn't near as cute either.

25:58.609 --> 26:02.350
Please Dr. Brand, I don't
have any idea what this is.

26:02.463 --> 26:05.629
But I'm scared for my daughter,
and I want her by my side.

26:05.705 --> 26:08.228
You give me that, and I'll tell
you anything you want to know.

26:11.260 --> 26:13.797
Take the principal and the
girl to the conference room.

26:14.989 --> 26:18.849
Your daughter is fine.
Bright kid.

26:18.927 --> 26:23.461
Must have a very smart mother. -It's
pretty clear you don't want any visitors.

26:23.573 --> 26:27.878
Why don't you let us back up from your
fence and we'll be on our way, huh?

26:28.021 --> 26:30.801
It's not that simple.
- Well, sure it is.

26:30.913 --> 26:33.953
Look I don't know anything about you. I
don't know anything about this place.

26:34.008 --> 26:36.239
Yes you do.

26:41.097 --> 26:43.003
Dad!

26:45.934 --> 26:47.230
Hello Cooper.

26:48.492 --> 26:49.718
Professor Brand.

26:51.056 --> 26:53.684
Explain to me how you
found this facility.

26:53.762 --> 26:57.220
Kind of accidently stumbled upon it.
We were on a salvage run...

26:57.331 --> 26:59.851
You're sitting in the best
kept secret in the world.

26:59.922 --> 27:02.757
Nobody stumbles in here,
nobody stumbles out.

27:03.639 --> 27:07.698
Cooper, please, cooperate
with these people.

27:07.843 --> 27:12.013
Well, it's kinda
hard to explain.

27:12.087 --> 27:16.122
We we.., we learnt
these coordinates...

27:16.123 --> 27:18.763
from an anomaly.
- What sort of anomaly?

27:18.874 --> 27:22.699
I hesitate to term it supernatural but
it damn well wasn't scientific...

27:22.812 --> 27:27.650
You're gonna have to be specific Mr.
Cooper, right now. -It was gravity.

27:32.605 --> 27:35.412
Um what sort of gravitational
an-where was this thing?

27:35.492 --> 27:38.908
Hey, I'm real happy that you're
excited about gravity bud, but...

27:38.909 --> 27:43.478
you're not getting any answers from us
until I get assurances. -Assurances? -Yeah.

27:44.530 --> 27:48.510
Like that we're getting out of here, and
I don't mean in the trunk of some car.

27:49.867 --> 27:54.349
Don't you know who we are Coop?
- No Professor, I don't.

27:54.457 --> 27:58.059
You know my father Professor Brand.
We're NASA.

27:59.584 --> 28:02.079
NASA. -NASA.

28:02.222 --> 28:04.744
The same NASA, you flew for.

28:14.134 --> 28:18.530
I heard they shut you down sir, for
refusing to drop bombs from...

28:18.611 --> 28:21.048
the stratosphere on
the starving people.

28:21.266 --> 28:23.764
When they realized that
killing other people...

28:23.765 --> 28:28.299
was not a long term solution,
then they needed us back. In secret.

28:28.411 --> 28:30.879
Why secret? -Because
public opinion wouldn't

28:30.891 --> 28:32.930
allow spending on
space exploration.

28:33.007 --> 28:35.765
Not when you're struggling
to put food on the table.

28:35.874 --> 28:41.159
Blight. Wheat, seven years ago.

28:41.272 --> 28:44.434
Okra, this year. -Now,
there's just corn.

28:44.547 --> 28:47.145
And we're growing more
than we ever had.

28:47.256 --> 28:51.605
Yeah, but like the potatoes in Ireland
and the wheat in the dust bowl...

28:51.714 --> 28:56.397
the corn will die. Soon.

29:01.475 --> 29:05.262
We'll find a way,
Professor, we always have.

29:05.376 --> 29:10.164
Driven by the unshakeable
faith that the Earth is ours?

29:10.279 --> 29:12.296
Well not just ours, no.

29:13.564 --> 29:14.824
But it is our home.

29:14.935 --> 29:19.475
Earth's atmosphere
is 80% nitrogen.

29:19.584 --> 29:21.515
We don't even breathe nitrogen.

29:21.660 --> 29:26.241
Blight does, and as it thrives, our
air gets less and less oxygen.

29:26.349 --> 29:30.178
The last people to starve, will
be the first to suffocate.

29:30.293 --> 29:32.577
And your daughter's
generation...

29:33.476 --> 29:36.347
will be the last
to survive on Earth.

29:36.459 --> 29:38.272
Murph is feeling a
little tired, and was

29:38.284 --> 29:40.421
wondering if she could
take a nap in my office?

29:40.531 --> 29:41.952
Yeah, thank you.

29:44.885 --> 29:46.003
Okay.

29:46.147 --> 29:50.211
Now you need to tell me, what
your plan is to save the world?

29:51.548 --> 29:55.169
We're not meant to save the world.
We're meant to leave it.

30:00.613 --> 30:05.194
Rangers. -The last components of
our one versatile ship in orbit.

30:05.274 --> 30:09.105
The Endurance. Our
final expedition.

30:09.214 --> 30:13.183
You sent people out there
looking for a new home?

30:13.291 --> 30:16.185
The Lazarus missions.
- Sounds cheerful!

30:16.292 --> 30:20.552
Lazarus came back from the dead. -Sure,
but he had to die in the first place.

30:20.662 --> 30:23.087
There's not a planet in our solar
system that could sustain...

30:23.088 --> 30:26.569
life and the nearest star
is over a 1000 years away.

30:26.604 --> 30:28.703
I mean, it doesn't even
qualify as futile.

30:30.010 --> 30:32.135
Where did you send them?

30:32.206 --> 30:38.004
Cooper, I can't tell you any more
unless you agree to pilot this craft.

30:38.120 --> 30:42.514
You're the best pilot we ever had.
- I barely left the stratosphere.

30:42.622 --> 30:44.925
This team never
left the simulator!

30:44.998 --> 30:48.460
We need a pilot, and this is the
mission that you were trained for.

30:48.566 --> 30:50.544
What, without even knowing?

30:50.690 --> 30:55.649
An hour ago, you didn't even know I
was alive, and you were going anyway.

30:55.831 --> 30:59.785
We had no choice. But
something sent you here.

30:59.930 --> 31:02.393
They chose you. -Who's 'They'?

31:10.142 --> 31:14.213
How long, would I be gone?
- Hard to know.

31:14.325 --> 31:18.232
Years. -I've got kids Professor.

31:18.343 --> 31:21.505
Get out there, and save them.

31:24.455 --> 31:28.190
Who's 'They'? -We started detecting
gravitational anomalies,

31:28.309 --> 31:30.044
almost 50 years ago.

31:30.079 --> 31:33.727
Mostly small distortions to our
instruments in the upper atmosphere.

31:33.840 --> 31:37.004
In fact I believe you
encountered one yourself.

31:37.116 --> 31:39.411
Yeah, in the Straits.

31:39.524 --> 31:43.694
My crash, something
tripped my fly-by-wire.

31:43.770 --> 31:50.628
Exactly. But of all these anomalies,
the most significant is this.

31:50.774 --> 31:54.692
Out near Saturn. A
disturbance of space-time.

31:56.252 --> 32:00.389
Is that a wormhole? -It
appeared 48 years ago.

32:00.539 --> 32:04.597
And it leads, where?
- Another galaxy.

32:05.967 --> 32:09.060
A wormhole is not a naturally
occurring phenomenon.

32:09.167 --> 32:11.702
Someone placed it there.
- 'They'?

32:12.962 --> 32:16.934
And whoever they are, they
appear to be looking out for us.

32:17.043 --> 32:20.179
That wormhole let us
travel to other stars.

32:20.298 --> 32:22.452
It came right around
when we needed it.

32:22.547 --> 32:25.688
They've put potentially habitable
worlds right within our reach.

32:25.832 --> 32:29.701
Twelve, in fact from our initial probes.
- You sent probes into that?

32:29.847 --> 32:33.381
We sent people into
it, 10 years ago.

32:33.494 --> 32:36.044
The Lazarus missions.

32:36.550 --> 32:39.784
12 possible worlds,
12 Ranger launches.

32:39.785 --> 32:43.129
Carrying the bravest
humans ever to live.

32:43.307 --> 32:46.084
Led by the remarkable Dr. Mann.

32:46.360 --> 32:49.361
Each person's landing pod had
enough life support for two years.

32:49.428 --> 32:51.015
But they could use hibernation
to stretch that...

32:51.124 --> 32:55.120
making observations on
organics over a decade or more.

32:55.270 --> 32:57.529
Their mission was to
assess their world and...

32:57.606 --> 32:59.485
if it showed potential,
then they could send

32:59.497 --> 33:01.310
out a signal and bed
down for the long nap...

33:01.419 --> 33:05.743
wait to be rescued. -And what
if the world didn't show promise?

33:06.135 --> 33:07.789
Hence the bravery.

33:07.898 --> 33:12.120
You don't have the resources
to visit all 12. -No.

33:13.699 --> 33:16.039
Data transmission back through
the wormhole is rudimentary.

33:16.148 --> 33:19.030
Simple binary pings
on an annual basis...

33:19.126 --> 33:23.823
give us some clue as to which worlds
have potential. One system shows promise.

33:23.895 --> 33:26.192
Well one, that's a bit
of a long shot isn't it?

33:26.621 --> 33:29.796
One system with 3
potential worlds?

33:29.908 --> 33:31.695
Not a long shot.

33:34.109 --> 33:37.924
Wait. So if we find a home...

33:41.606 --> 33:44.889
then what? -That's
the long shot.

33:45.047 --> 33:48.246
There is a plan A, and a plan B.

33:48.358 --> 33:52.278
Did you notice anything strange
about the launch chamber?

34:02.690 --> 34:06.465
This entire facility
is a centrifuge.

34:06.612 --> 34:11.591
Some kind of vehicle? A space station?
- Both. The plan A.

34:11.706 --> 34:13.214
How do you get it
off the ground?

34:13.397 --> 34:17.637
The first gravitational
anomalies changed everything.

34:17.784 --> 34:22.173
Suddenly we knew that
harnessing gravity was real.

34:22.319 --> 34:26.196
So I started working on a
theory and we started...

34:26.267 --> 34:29.510
building this station. -But
you haven't solved it yet.

34:29.656 --> 34:32.350
That's why there's a plan B.

34:32.534 --> 34:34.700
The problem is gravity.

34:34.847 --> 34:37.689
How to get a viable amount of
human life off the planet?

34:37.876 --> 34:41.871
This is one way. The plan B.
Population bomb.

34:41.982 --> 34:46.217
Over 5000 fertilized eggs weighing
in at just under 900 kilos.

34:47.701 --> 34:50.014
How would you raise 'em?
- With the equipment

34:50.026 --> 34:51.834
onboard we incubate
the first ten.

34:51.995 --> 34:55.615
After that, with surrogacy the
growth becomes exponential.

34:55.761 --> 34:59.789
In 30 years, we could have
a colony of hundreds.

34:59.902 --> 35:03.983
The real difficulty with
colonization is genetic diversity.

35:04.018 --> 35:05.154
This will take care of that.

35:05.335 --> 35:10.047
Yeah, but what about the people here?
You just, you'd give up on 'em?

35:10.191 --> 35:15.165
My kids? -That's why Plan
A is a lot more fun.

35:17.191 --> 35:20.747
How far have you got?
- Almost there.

35:20.890 --> 35:23.768
You're asking me to
hang everything...

35:23.920 --> 35:28.387
on an 'almost'. -I'm
asking you to trust me.

35:30.978 --> 35:33.497
Find us a new home.

35:33.645 --> 35:38.096
And by the time you return, I
would've solved the problem...

35:38.422 --> 35:41.650
of gravity. I
give you my word.

35:54.320 --> 35:55.621
Go away!

36:06.494 --> 36:10.697
Murph. -Go. If you're
leaving just go!

36:13.188 --> 36:17.352
This world was never enough
for you, was it Cooper?

36:17.437 --> 36:21.892
What, cause heading out there is what
I feel like... I was born to do?

36:21.980 --> 36:23.883
And it excites me?

36:24.031 --> 36:28.352
Nah, it does not make it wrong.
- It might.

36:28.502 --> 36:32.295
Don't trust the right thing
done for the wrong reason.

36:32.744 --> 36:37.324
The 'why' of the thing, that's the
foundation. -And the foundation's solid.

36:39.659 --> 36:43.208
We farmers, we sit here
every year when...

36:43.243 --> 36:47.171
the rains fail, and
we say: Next year.

36:47.318 --> 36:51.380
Well, next year ain't gonna save
us, nor the one after that.

36:51.490 --> 36:56.198
This world's a treasure Donald, but it's
been telling us to leave for a while now.

37:00.591 --> 37:04.721
Mankind was born on Earth, it
was never meant to die here.

37:07.866 --> 37:12.387
Tom will be alright, but you got to
make things right with Murph. -I will.

37:12.702 --> 37:16.442
Without making promises you
don't know you can keep.

37:26.975 --> 37:29.889
You have to talk to me Murph.

37:31.397 --> 37:34.779
I need to fix this before I go.

37:34.936 --> 37:37.408
Then I'll keep it broken
so you'll have to stay.

37:38.641 --> 37:41.698
After you kids came
along, your mom, she said

37:41.710 --> 37:44.513
something to me I never
quite understood.

37:44.662 --> 37:49.407
She said: Now,
we're just here...

37:50.232 --> 37:52.572
to be the memories for our kids.

37:57.214 --> 38:00.170
I think I now understand
what she meant.

38:02.980 --> 38:07.794
Once you're a parent, you're the
ghost of your children's future.

38:08.886 --> 38:11.700
You said ghosts didn't exist.

38:17.743 --> 38:19.469
That's right Murph.

38:22.025 --> 38:24.469
Look at me.

38:26.947 --> 38:29.486
I can't be your ghost right now.

38:31.213 --> 38:33.223
I need to exist.

38:34.485 --> 38:37.249
They chose me.

38:37.440 --> 38:41.282
Murph, they chose me. You saw it.
You're the one who led me to 'em.

38:43.400 --> 38:46.779
And that's exactly
why you can't go!

38:49.842 --> 38:54.819
I figured out the message. One word.
You know what it is?

38:54.929 --> 38:57.530
Murph. -STAY.

38:57.680 --> 39:00.954
It says STAY dad. -Murph.

39:01.067 --> 39:05.868
You don't believe me! Look at the books.
Look it says STAY.

39:05.986 --> 39:10.380
Why are you not listening? IT SAYS STAY!
- I'm coming back.

39:10.489 --> 39:12.610
When??

39:24.692 --> 39:28.480
One for you. One for me.

39:28.586 --> 39:30.493
When I'm up there in hyper sleep,

39:30.687 --> 39:34.216
or, or traveling at
the speed of light,

39:34.403 --> 39:36.856
or, near a black hole,

39:37.000 --> 39:40.306
Time is gonna change for me.

39:40.451 --> 39:42.620
And it's gonna run more slowly.

39:42.757 --> 39:45.742
So, when we get back,

39:45.927 --> 39:50.575
we're gonna compare. -Time
will run differently for us?

39:50.688 --> 39:51.518
Yeah.

39:51.631 --> 39:55.769
Maybe by the time I get back, you
and I, we might be the same age.

39:55.918 --> 39:58.436
You and me. What??

39:58.585 --> 40:00.024
Imagine that!

40:03.661 --> 40:07.731
Ah, Murph. -You've no idea
when you're coming back!!

40:09.217 --> 40:13.003
No idea at all! -Murph.

40:14.297 --> 40:18.324
Murph, don't ma-, don't make
me leave like this. Murph!

40:18.506 --> 40:21.100
Don't make me leave
like this Murph!!

40:27.180 --> 40:31.882
Hey,...I love you.

40:32.065 --> 40:35.895
You hear me? I love you forever.

40:36.040 --> 40:37.407
And I'm coming back.

40:43.423 --> 40:44.905
I'm coming back.

41:02.627 --> 41:05.370
How did it go? -Fine.

41:05.485 --> 41:06.921
Just fine.

41:14.839 --> 41:19.779
I love you Tom. -Travel safe, okay? -Yeah.
Take care of our place for me alright?

41:19.892 --> 41:23.146
Huh? -Uh huh.

41:26.138 --> 41:29.527
Hey, can I use your truck while
you're gone? -You mean your truck?

41:31.113 --> 41:33.090
I'll make sure they
bring it back.

41:34.320 --> 41:36.661
Look after my kids Donald.

41:49.617 --> 41:53.282
Go for main engines.
Start T minus 10.

41:53.744 --> 41:57.993
Dad! -9 -Dad!!

41:58.028 --> 42:02.467
8, 7. -DAD!!!

42:03.265 --> 42:07.815
6, 5. Main engines start.

42:07.928 --> 42:15.928
4, 3, 2, 1. Booster
ignition, and.

42:24.885 --> 42:27.511
All engines look good.
Beginning roll program.

42:30.247 --> 42:35.064
Prepare for stage
one separation.

42:35.217 --> 42:37.006
Stage one.

42:42.805 --> 42:48.199
Everybody good? Plenty of
slaves for my robot colony?

42:49.670 --> 42:53.768
They gave him a humor setting,
to fit in better with his unit.

42:53.769 --> 42:58.460
He thinks it relaxes us.
- A giant sarcastic robot!

42:59.798 --> 43:03.791
What a great idea! -I have a cue light I
could use when I'm joking, if you'd like?

43:03.826 --> 43:05.066
That wouldn't be a problem, no.

43:05.135 --> 43:07.281
Yeah you could use it to
find your way back into

43:07.293 --> 43:09.230
the ship after I blow
you out the air lock.

43:09.381 --> 43:12.270
What's your humor setting TARS?

43:12.350 --> 43:15.276
100% -Let's bring it
down to 75 please.

43:15.565 --> 43:18.229
Stage two separation.

43:27.490 --> 43:31.519
All feeds going manual.
- Going manual.

43:33.789 --> 43:37.644
Deactivate probe heater 1, 2 and 3.
- Check.

43:41.204 --> 43:46.100
Taking control. -This
is handover to you.

43:49.205 --> 43:51.683
ABF check. Over.

43:51.834 --> 43:56.378
Retro thrusters
fuel cells 1, 2, 3.

43:56.413 --> 44:00.049
100% ex-mites.

44:07.320 --> 44:11.837
It's hard leaving everything.
My kids.

44:11.985 --> 44:15.921
Your father. -We're gonna be
spending a lot of time together,

44:16.043 --> 44:19.601
- We should learn to talk.
- And when not to.

44:20.655 --> 44:25.478
Just being honest. -Well you
don't need to be that honest.

44:25.585 --> 44:30.010
Hey TARS, what's your
honesty parameter? -90%

44:30.155 --> 44:31.633
90%?

44:31.745 --> 44:35.273
Absolute honesty isn't always
the most diplomatic...

44:35.391 --> 44:39.022
nor the safest form of communication
with emotional beings. -Okay!

44:39.132 --> 44:41.478
90% it is Dr. Brand.

44:45.222 --> 44:48.532
We're coming up on the Endurance.
12 minutes out.

45:05.338 --> 45:07.605
Okay taking control.

45:10.888 --> 45:13.836
Approaching module
port, 500 meters.

45:26.747 --> 45:28.655
It's all you Doyle.

45:46.023 --> 45:49.691
Nice and easy Doyle,
nice and easy.

45:53.661 --> 45:57.481
Take us home.

46:03.900 --> 46:06.815
Target locked.

46:06.961 --> 46:09.379
Target locked. -Well done.
- Okay, helmets on.

46:09.535 --> 46:10.535
Good job.

46:43.761 --> 46:46.799
The door is not charging.
Never mind!

47:09.842 --> 47:13.342
Cooper, you should have control.
- Control here.

47:14.429 --> 47:17.062
Communication with
ring module active.

47:30.889 --> 47:32.652
That's initiate.

47:40.213 --> 47:42.410
Are we ready to spin?
- Just a sec.

47:53.354 --> 47:56.410
Hello CASE. -Hello TARS.

47:57.132 --> 48:00.804
Okay, we're all set.
- All right let's do it.

48:30.498 --> 48:32.048
30% of spin.

48:37.814 --> 48:39.466
One g.

48:40.626 --> 48:44.227
How is gravity treating
you back there?

48:47.173 --> 48:51.143
Romilly, hey you okay? -Yeah.
- You all right?

48:51.254 --> 48:52.454
Yeah, no I just need a minute.

48:53.030 --> 48:56.307
Okay, I think we have some Dramamine in
the hibe pad, I'm just gonna go get that.

48:56.419 --> 48:59.690
It'll be in the cryo beds Just be a sec.
- Hey Brand?

48:59.809 --> 49:01.321
Yeah? -Bring a lot.

49:09.771 --> 49:13.439
Amelia, be safe.

49:13.592 --> 49:17.720
Give my regards to Dr.
Mann. -I will Dad.

49:17.831 --> 49:22.791
It looks good for your trajectory.
We've calculated, two years to Saturn.

49:22.906 --> 49:24.711
That's a lot of Dramamine.

49:25.865 --> 49:27.880
Look after my family
will you please, sir?

49:28.023 --> 49:31.260
We'll be waiting for
you, when you get back.

49:31.801 --> 49:36.333
A little older, a little
wiser, but happy to see you.

49:38.316 --> 49:41.771
'Do not go gentle into
that good night, '

49:41.962 --> 49:46.664
'old age should burn and
rave at close of day, '

49:47.963 --> 49:52.567
'Rage, rage against the
dying of the light.'

49:53.771 --> 49:57.809
'Though wise men at their
end, know dark is right.'

49:57.955 --> 50:00.829
'Because their words had
forked no lightning they'

50:01.013 --> 50:04.384
'Do not go gentle,
into that good night'

50:04.966 --> 50:09.710
'Rage, rage against the
dying of the light.'

50:33.361 --> 50:35.085
Here, pills.

50:37.896 --> 50:42.028
So alone. -We have each other.
Dr. Mann had it worse.

50:42.137 --> 50:43.436
I mean them.

50:46.130 --> 50:49.050
It's a perfect planet and we're not
gonna find another one like it.

50:49.228 --> 50:53.579
No, it's not like,
looking for a new condo.

50:53.729 --> 50:57.803
The human race is
going to be, adrift.

50:57.949 --> 51:01.876
Desperate for a rock it can cling
to while it catches it's breath.

51:01.911 --> 51:03.569
We need to find that rock,

51:04.470 --> 51:08.698
and our 3 prospects are at the edge
of what might sustain human life.

51:09.621 --> 51:13.902
Laura Miller's planet is the first.
Laura started our biology program.

51:19.294 --> 51:22.395
Wolf Edmunds is here.
- Tell me about Edmunds.

51:23.436 --> 51:25.844
Oh, um, Wolf's a
particle physicist.

51:28.441 --> 51:30.206
Any of them had any families?

51:31.614 --> 51:34.515
No, no attachments.
My father insisted.

51:34.704 --> 51:37.327
They 'all knew the
possibility of...

51:37.402 --> 51:40.330
seeing another human being again. I'm
hoping we can surprise at least 3 of them.

51:40.480 --> 51:44.741
Dr. Mann? -Dr. Mann, well, he's remarkable.
He's the best of us.

51:44.921 --> 51:47.804
He inspired 11 people to follow
him on the loneliest journey...

51:47.889 --> 51:49.836
in human history.

51:49.871 --> 51:52.238
Scientists, explorers.
That's what I love.

51:52.382 --> 51:55.404
You know out there, we
would face great odds.

51:55.560 --> 51:59.745
Death. But, not evil.

51:59.892 --> 52:02.228
You don't think
nature can be evil?

52:02.373 --> 52:07.193
No. Formidable, frightening.
But, no, not evil.

52:08.608 --> 52:12.495
Is a lion evil because it
rips a gazelle to shreds?

52:12.647 --> 52:14.481
Just what we take with us then?

52:15.318 --> 52:19.349
Yeah. This crew represents
the best of humanity.

52:19.495 --> 52:22.532
Even me, huh? -You know what?
We agreed, 90%.

52:22.675 --> 52:24.842
Don't stay up.

52:24.949 --> 52:26.114
I'll be in a minute.

52:26.273 --> 52:30.418
Just remember Coop, you're
literally wasting your breath.

52:36.833 --> 52:39.962
Hey TARS, let's go over that
trajectory one more time.

52:40.970 --> 52:44.886
8 months to Mars. Gravity
powered slingshot around,

52:45.000 --> 52:47.345
14 months to Saturn. Nothing
has changed on that.

52:47.493 --> 52:48.970
Let me ask you something.

52:51.454 --> 52:54.692
Dr. Brand and Edmunds. -Why are you
whispering? They can't hear you.

52:56.568 --> 53:01.540
Dr. Brand and Edmunds, they close?
- I wouldn't know.

53:01.728 --> 53:04.613
Is that '90% wouldn't know'
or '10% wouldn't know'?

53:04.760 --> 53:06.812
I also have a discretion
setting Cooper.

53:08.470 --> 53:12.177
But not a poker-face slick.

53:23.663 --> 53:24.961
Hey guys.

53:25.108 --> 53:28.782
Dad's about to go down
for the long nap.

53:28.928 --> 53:31.732
And I just, wanted to
give you an update.

53:31.885 --> 53:35.745
The Earth looks
amazing from here.

53:35.896 --> 53:40.035
You can't see any of the dust.

53:41.012 --> 53:44.432
I really hope you guys
are doin', doin' great.

53:44.579 --> 53:47.325
I know you're gonna
get this message,

53:47.435 --> 53:49.736
Professor Brand assured
me that he was gonna

53:49.748 --> 53:51.855
get it to you. Alright,
okay I love you!

53:53.336 --> 53:55.468
Is it him? -I don't
think so Murph.

54:02.058 --> 54:04.432
You must be Donald.

54:05.728 --> 54:10.314
Hello Murph. -Why are
you in my dad's truck?

54:10.465 --> 54:13.127
He wanted me to bring
it for your brother.

54:13.275 --> 54:15.903
He sent you a message.

54:19.335 --> 54:21.275
She's pretty upset
with him for leaving.

54:21.421 --> 54:24.802
If you record any messages I can
get them transmitted to Cooper.

54:26.244 --> 54:33.303
Murph is a bright spark.
Maybe, I should fan the flame.

54:33.338 --> 54:35.647
She's already making fools
of her teachers, well,

54:35.659 --> 54:37.980
maybe she should come and
make a fool out of you.

54:39.275 --> 54:42.513
So where are they?
- Heading for Mars.

54:42.625 --> 54:47.014
The next time you hear from Cooper,
they'll be coming up on Saturn.

55:26.315 --> 55:30.376
They want me to repeat
plant pathology.

55:30.523 --> 55:35.958
It sucks. But, they said I could start
advanced agriculture a year early.

55:36.424 --> 55:39.883
So... alright. Well,
I gotta go Dad.

55:40.070 --> 55:41.145
Hope you're safe up there.

55:44.333 --> 55:49.005
Sorry Coop, I asked
Murph to say hi.

55:49.079 --> 55:54.016
But she's as stubborn as her old man.
I'll try again next time.

56:09.278 --> 56:10.682
Are you okay Rom?

56:11.910 --> 56:16.603
This gets to me Cooper.
This, this.

56:16.744 --> 56:20.200
Millimeters of aluminum
protecting us and then nothing...

56:20.346 --> 56:24.054
out there for millions of
miles, won't kill us in seconds.

56:25.134 --> 56:30.048
Did you know that some of the finest
solo yachtsmen in the world...

56:30.083 --> 56:34.741
don't know how to swim? They don't know,
and if they go overboard, it's done.

56:36.338 --> 56:38.578
We are explorers Rom.

56:39.918 --> 56:43.132
This is our boat. Here.

57:10.163 --> 57:14.937
This is the, relay probe? -In
orbit around the wormhole.

57:15.051 --> 57:17.566
This is the wormhole and
every time we come around...

57:17.711 --> 57:21.416
we would receive images from the
other side of the foreign galaxy.

57:21.527 --> 57:25.015
Like swinging a periscope around.
- Exactly.

57:25.129 --> 57:29.030
So we got a pretty good idea, what we're
gonna find on the other side, huh?

57:30.329 --> 57:31.982
Navigationally.

57:33.104 --> 57:35.175
Hey guys, looks like we're
gonna be approaching

57:35.187 --> 57:36.705
the wormhole in
about three hours.

57:43.586 --> 57:46.721
Hey Coop, can we
stop the spinning?

57:46.835 --> 57:50.790
Why? -Because we are
close enough to see it.

57:52.304 --> 57:54.971
Aha.

57:59.191 --> 58:03.403
Look, that's, that's it!
That's the wormhole!

58:03.546 --> 58:06.473
Say it, don't spray it Rom.
It's a sphere.

58:06.619 --> 58:10.176
Well of course it is! What you
thought it would just be a hole?

58:11.226 --> 58:15.107
No. It's just that all the
illustrations I've ever seen they...

58:15.272 --> 58:19.117
The illustrations, try
to show how it works.

58:19.235 --> 58:23.439
So they say you want to
go from here, to there.

58:23.593 --> 58:25.078
But this is too far.

58:25.261 --> 58:28.884
So a wormhole bends space
like this so you...

58:28.919 --> 58:32.507
can take a shortcut
through a higher dimension.

58:32.618 --> 58:37.412
Okay so, to show that they've
turned 3-dimensional space...

58:37.488 --> 58:41.785
into 2 dimensions, which turns
a wormhole in 2 dimensions...

58:41.804 --> 58:44.952
a circle. What's a
circle in 3 dimensions?

58:46.147 --> 58:49.314
A sphere. -Exactly.
A spherical hole.

58:49.859 --> 58:53.439
But who put it there? Who
do we have to thank?

58:53.660 --> 58:58.374
I'm not thanking anybody until we
get outta here in one piece Rom.

59:03.694 --> 59:06.791
Any trick to this Doyle?

59:08.168 --> 59:09.530
No one knows.

59:15.971 --> 59:18.814
The others made it, right?

59:20.584 --> 59:22.638
At least some of 'em.

59:53.359 --> 59:57.491
Everybody ready to say
goodbye to our solar system?

59:57.638 --> 01:00:00.223
To our galaxy.

01:00:01.779 --> 01:00:03.478
Here we go.

01:00:35.695 --> 01:00:39.152
Controls won't work here. We
are passing through the bulk.

01:00:39.264 --> 01:00:44.090
Its space beyond our 3 dimensions. All
you can do is report and observe.

01:00:54.008 --> 01:00:56.532
What is that?

01:00:57.806 --> 01:01:02.597
I think it's 'Them'.
- Distorting space-time?

01:01:03.975 --> 01:01:06.279
Don't. Don't!

01:01:33.900 --> 01:01:34.900
What was that?

01:01:37.255 --> 01:01:39.378
First handshake.

01:01:41.054 --> 01:01:42.322
We're...

01:01:43.405 --> 01:01:44.737
We're here.

01:02:05.707 --> 01:02:08.910
So the lost communications
came through. -How?

01:02:09.023 --> 01:02:13.985
The relay on this side cached them. It's
years of basic data, no real surprises.

01:02:14.966 --> 01:02:19.480
Miller's site has kept pinging
'thumbs up', as has Dr. Mann's.

01:02:19.515 --> 01:02:23.319
Edmunds went down three years ago.
- Transmitter failure?

01:02:23.428 --> 01:02:26.313
Maybe. He was sending the thumbs
up right until it went dark.

01:02:26.462 --> 01:02:30.079
But Miller's still looks good though,
right? Because she's coming up fast.

01:02:30.191 --> 01:02:32.428
But there's one complication.

01:02:32.501 --> 01:02:36.577
The planet is much closer to
Gargantua than we thought.

01:02:36.648 --> 01:02:39.775
Gargantua? -It's what we're
calling the black hole.

01:02:39.925 --> 01:02:41.967
Miller's and Dr. Mann's
planets both orbit it.

01:02:42.002 --> 01:02:45.194
And Miller's is on the horizon?
- Like a basketball around a hoop.

01:02:45.308 --> 01:02:47.915
Landing there takes us
dangerously close...

01:02:48.091 --> 01:02:51.185
and a black hole that big
has a huge gravitational pull.

01:02:53.298 --> 01:02:56.820
Okay I-, I could swing
around that neutron star...

01:02:56.934 --> 01:02:59.485
- No no no, it's not that, it's time.
The gravity on that planet will...

01:02:59.632 --> 01:03:02.920
slow our clock compared to Earth's,..
Drastically.

01:03:02.955 --> 01:03:04.683
Well how bad?

01:03:04.794 --> 01:03:11.596
Well, every hour we spend on that planet
will be, uhh, seven years back on Earth.

01:03:12.927 --> 01:03:15.804
Jesus. -That's relativity folks.

01:03:16.930 --> 01:03:20.204
Well, we can't just drop down
there without... -Cooper...

01:03:20.352 --> 01:03:22.790
We have a mission. -Yeah
Doyle, we have a mission.

01:03:22.896 --> 01:03:25.437
And our mission, Plan A
is to find a planet...

01:03:25.472 --> 01:03:27.978
that can habitat the people that
are living on the Earth right now.

01:03:28.087 --> 01:03:29.374
You can't just think
about your family, now

01:03:29.386 --> 01:03:30.714
you have to think bigger
than that, alright?

01:03:30.864 --> 01:03:33.809
I'm thinking about my family and
millions of other families.

01:03:33.891 --> 01:03:36.397
Okay, Plan A does not
work, if the people on

01:03:36.409 --> 01:03:38.816
Earth are dead by the
time we pull it off.

01:03:39.686 --> 01:03:43.058
No, it doesn't. That's
why there's a Plan B.

01:03:44.754 --> 01:03:49.225
Okay. Cooper's right. We have to think
about time as a resource just like...

01:03:49.335 --> 01:03:51.676
oxygen and food. Going
down there is gonna cost us.

01:03:51.858 --> 01:03:58.048
Okay look, Dr. Mann's data
is promising, alright,

01:03:58.192 --> 01:04:01.670
but it's gonna take us months to get
there, and Edmunds, it's even further.

01:04:01.705 --> 01:04:04.237
Now Miller hasn't said much. But
what she has said is very promising.

01:04:04.387 --> 01:04:07.141
It's water, it's organics.
- You don't find that everyday.

01:04:07.219 --> 01:04:10.662
No, you don't and just think about
the resources including time...

01:04:10.780 --> 01:04:13.038
that would be spent
trying to get back here.

01:04:14.526 --> 01:04:16.148
Romilly. -Yeah.

01:04:16.183 --> 01:04:20.594
How far off of Miller's planet do we have
to be to stay out of the time shift?

01:04:20.629 --> 01:04:24.876
Alright, just back from the cusp. -Which
is here, just outside of Miller's planet.

01:04:24.992 --> 01:04:27.428
Alright. Okay.

01:04:27.547 --> 01:04:30.811
Here's Gargantua,
here's Miller's planet.

01:04:30.959 --> 01:04:34.597
Instead of taking the Endurance into orbit
around Miller's planet, which would...

01:04:34.632 --> 01:04:37.443
conserve fuel, but
we'd lose a lot of time,

01:04:37.478 --> 01:04:39.838
what if, what if we take
a wider orbit around

01:04:39.850 --> 01:04:42.016
Gargantua, parallel
with Miller's planet,

01:04:42.125 --> 01:04:45.546
outside of it's time shift, to here.
Then we take the Ranger down,

01:04:45.581 --> 01:04:48.565
we get Miller, we get her samples, we
come back, we analyze, we debrief...

01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:52.421
we're in, we're out, we lose a
little fuel. But we save a lot of time.

01:04:52.538 --> 01:04:54.498
That'll work. -That's good.
- There's not gonna...

01:04:54.593 --> 01:04:56.395
be time for monkey
business or chit-chat down

01:04:56.407 --> 01:04:58.340
there, so TARS, you should
definitely stay here.

01:04:59.498 --> 01:05:02.135
CASE, you're with me.
Anyone else can stay.

01:05:02.282 --> 01:05:04.591
If we are talking about
a couple of years,

01:05:04.786 --> 01:05:06.868
I could use the time
to research gravity,

01:05:07.013 --> 01:05:09.499
observations from the wormhole,
that's gold to Professor Brand.

01:05:09.609 --> 01:05:13.903
TARS, factor an orbit around Gargantua,
conserve fuel, minimize thrusting.

01:05:14.018 --> 01:05:16.427
Make sure we stay in range from
Miller's planet. You got it?

01:05:16.545 --> 01:05:19.759
I wouldn't leave you behind, Dr.
Brand.

01:05:24.478 --> 01:05:28.101
You ready CASE? -Yep. -You
don't say much do you?

01:05:28.713 --> 01:05:33.009
TARS talks plenty for both of us.
- Detach.

01:05:39.889 --> 01:05:43.187
Romilly, are you reading these forces?
- Unbelievable.

01:05:46.930 --> 01:05:48.622
A literal heart of darkness.

01:05:51.504 --> 01:05:55.777
If we could just see the
collapsed star inside,

01:05:55.925 --> 01:05:58.798
the singularity,
we'd solve gravity.

01:05:58.911 --> 01:06:02.265
We can't get anything from it?
- Nothing escapes that horizon,

01:06:02.416 --> 01:06:06.317
not even light. All the answers
are there, just no way to see it.

01:06:06.469 --> 01:06:07.827
There's Miller's planet.

01:06:10.395 --> 01:06:11.395
Goodbye Ranger.

01:06:24.117 --> 01:06:28.549
This is fast for atmospheric entry.
Shouldn't we use the thrusters to slow?

01:06:28.629 --> 01:06:32.710
- No. I'm gonna use the Ranger's
aerodynamics to save some fuel.

01:06:32.819 --> 01:06:35.849
Air-brake? -We wanna get
down fast don't we?

01:06:35.957 --> 01:06:39.352
Actually we wanna get there
in one piece. -Hang on.

01:06:39.425 --> 01:06:41.110
Brand, Doyle, get ready.

01:06:56.945 --> 01:06:59.677
We should be using the air-brake.
- Hands up CASE.

01:06:59.757 --> 01:07:03.176
The only time I ever went down is when a
machine was easing at the wrong time.

01:07:03.290 --> 01:07:06.406
You're going to get us killed.
- Just like reckless driving.

01:07:06.682 --> 01:07:08.323
We're too fast. -I got this.

01:07:13.055 --> 01:07:17.126
Should I get ready to detach? -No.
I need to feel the air.

01:07:21.131 --> 01:07:22.326
Here we go.

01:07:23.771 --> 01:07:26.574
It's just water!

01:07:26.683 --> 01:07:31.430
The stuff of life. -1200 meters.

01:07:31.547 --> 01:07:34.622
Do we have a fix on her beacon?
- That I have, can you maneuver?

01:07:34.731 --> 01:07:37.094
I gonna need to shave some speed.
I'm gonna

01:07:37.106 --> 01:07:39.534
spiral down on top of
it, everybody hang on!

01:07:40.941 --> 01:07:42.855
700.

01:07:44.801 --> 01:07:47.154
On my cue CASE, on my cue.

01:07:49.988 --> 01:07:51.429
500 meters.

01:08:00.614 --> 01:08:02.056
Now!

01:08:16.132 --> 01:08:17.381
Very graceful.

01:08:17.451 --> 01:08:21.873
No, but very efficient.

01:08:23.331 --> 01:08:26.081
What're you waiting for?
Let's go.

01:08:26.151 --> 01:08:29.862
Go, go, go, go. 7
years per hour here.

01:08:29.969 --> 01:08:31.262
Let's make it count.

01:08:57.449 --> 01:08:58.449
This way.

01:09:00.965 --> 01:09:03.055
About 200 meters.

01:09:13.062 --> 01:09:17.664
Gravity's punishing. -Been
floating through space too long?

01:09:17.777 --> 01:09:20.078
130% Earth's gravity.

01:09:21.450 --> 01:09:22.834
Come on, come on, come on.

01:09:24.996 --> 01:09:27.407
There's nothing here.
- should be right here.

01:09:29.075 --> 01:09:32.537
If the, if the signal's
coming from here, then...

01:09:41.939 --> 01:09:43.128
Her beacon.

01:09:51.083 --> 01:09:54.360
Wreckage. -Where's the rest?

01:09:54.433 --> 01:09:56.165
Towards the mountains.

01:09:59.483 --> 01:10:01.533
Those aren't mountains.

01:10:04.048 --> 01:10:06.395
They're waves. -What?

01:10:09.894 --> 01:10:11.372
Shit.

01:10:13.467 --> 01:10:15.588
That one's moving away from us.

01:10:20.665 --> 01:10:23.433
We need the recorder.

01:10:33.625 --> 01:10:36.326
Brand, Doyle, back
to the Ranger now!

01:10:36.404 --> 01:10:38.674
I'm not, leaving,
without, her data.

01:10:40.012 --> 01:10:44.278
Get back here now. We do not have time.
The second wave is coming!

01:10:44.391 --> 01:10:46.866
We are in the middle of a swell!

01:10:46.975 --> 01:10:50.752
Get your ass back
to the Ranger now!

01:10:54.285 --> 01:10:57.591
Brand get back here now!!

01:10:59.026 --> 01:11:02.937
Cooper, go, Cooper go,
I can't make it. Go!

01:11:03.050 --> 01:11:04.270
CASE, go get her.

01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:11.634
GO! -Get up, get up Brand.

01:11:11.779 --> 01:11:13.494
Go go, go.

01:11:14.686 --> 01:11:18.350
I'm not gonna make it! -Yes you are.
Yes you are!

01:11:24.990 --> 01:11:27.573
Come on CASE has her, CASE has her!
Get back here Doyle!

01:11:30.346 --> 01:11:31.821
Dr. Brand.

01:11:33.515 --> 01:11:35.275
To the hatch.

01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:41.302
Go, go. Go.

01:11:46.824 --> 01:11:50.861
Manually overriding
inside hatch!

01:11:54.208 --> 01:11:58.918
Cooper don't! Cooper don't!

01:11:59.081 --> 01:12:00.152
Cooper!

01:12:02.001 --> 01:12:05.848
Engines are flooded! I'll
have to shut it down!

01:12:38.989 --> 01:12:40.644
Oh shit!!

01:12:45.428 --> 01:12:46.761
Whoa!

01:13:17.867 --> 01:13:21.064
CASE what's wrong? -Chute's
waterlogged, let it drain.

01:13:21.895 --> 01:13:25.457
Goddamn it!! I told
you to leave me.

01:13:25.569 --> 01:13:27.974
- And I told you to get
your ass back here!

01:13:28.048 --> 01:13:31.669
The difference is that one of us
was thinkin' about the mission.

01:13:31.778 --> 01:13:33.619
- You were thinking
about getting home!!

01:13:34.642 --> 01:13:39.614
I was trying to do the right thing!
- Can you tell that to Doyle?

01:13:41.551 --> 01:13:44.504
CASE, how much time?
- 45 to an hour.

01:13:45.911 --> 01:13:47.626
The stuff of life huh?

01:13:48.674 --> 01:13:51.610
What's this gonna cost us Brand?
- A lot.

01:13:52.493 --> 01:13:53.493
Decades.

01:14:00.503 --> 01:14:03.384
What happened to Miller?
- Judging by...

01:14:03.499 --> 01:14:07.307
the wreckage she was broken
up by a wave soon after impact.

01:14:07.417 --> 01:14:10.878
How's the hell the wreckage stayed
together after all these years, huh?

01:14:12.141 --> 01:14:13.722
Because of the time slippage.

01:14:13.869 --> 01:14:17.491
On this planet's time she,

01:14:17.603 --> 01:14:19.624
she's landed hours ago, she...

01:14:19.699 --> 01:14:22.653
she probably just
died minutes ago.

01:14:22.764 --> 01:14:26.609
The data Doyle received was just the
initial status echoing endlessly.

01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:29.092
Oh we are not prepared for this.

01:14:31.509 --> 01:14:35.784
You eggheads have the survival
skills of a boy-scout troop.

01:14:35.816 --> 01:14:38.904
Well we got this far on our brains,
farther than any human in history.

01:14:39.224 --> 01:14:43.573
Well not far enough. And now we're stuck
here till there won't be anyone...

01:14:43.574 --> 01:14:44.760
left on Earth to save.

01:14:46.683 --> 01:14:50.242
I'm counting every minute
same as you Cooper.

01:14:53.993 --> 01:14:58.875
Is there any possibility? I dunno,
maybe some way, I don't know...

01:14:58.876 --> 01:15:03.000
maybe if we could jump in a black
hole and gain back the years?

01:15:03.502 --> 01:15:06.857
Don't shake your head at me!
Time is relative, okay.

01:15:06.965 --> 01:15:09.212
It can stretch and
it can squeeze, but,

01:15:09.282 --> 01:15:13.031
it can't run backwards!
Just can't!

01:15:13.109 --> 01:15:17.300
The only thing that can move across
dimensions, like time, is gravity.

01:15:19.612 --> 01:15:20.939
Okay.

01:15:22.809 --> 01:15:25.508
The beings that led us here,

01:15:25.619 --> 01:15:28.712
they communicate through
gravity, right?

01:15:28.863 --> 01:15:32.786
Could they be talking to us
from the future? -Maybe.

01:15:32.899 --> 01:15:36.403
Okay, if they can..? They...

01:15:36.518 --> 01:15:39.171
are beings of 5 dimensions!

01:15:39.288 --> 01:15:42.904
Right, to them, time might be
yet another physical dimension.

01:15:42.991 --> 01:15:47.532
To them, the past might be a
canyon they can climb into,

01:15:47.638 --> 01:15:52.360
and the future, a mountain that they can
climb up, but to us, it's not! Okay!

01:15:52.435 --> 01:15:56.376
Look Cooper, I screwed up.
I'm sorry.

01:15:57.674 --> 01:15:59.721
But you knew about relativity.

01:16:02.533 --> 01:16:03.533
Brand.

01:16:07.627 --> 01:16:10.586
My daughter is 10 years old.

01:16:10.701 --> 01:16:13.962
Couldn't teach her Einstein's
theories before I left,

01:16:13.997 --> 01:16:18.643
Couldn't you have told your daughter that
you were going to save the world? -No.

01:16:19.768 --> 01:16:24.476
When you become a parent, one
thing becomes really clear,

01:16:25.460 --> 01:16:29.273
And that's you wanna make
sure your children feel safe,

01:16:30.281 --> 01:16:34.101
and it rules out telling a 10 year
old, that the world's endin'.

01:16:36.416 --> 01:16:37.421
Cooper.

01:16:41.141 --> 01:16:44.543
How long for the engines CASE?
- A minute or two.

01:16:44.618 --> 01:16:46.790
Well we don't have it!
Helmets on!!

01:16:50.473 --> 01:16:55.283
Brand, co-pilot you're up. CASE, run the
cabin oxygen through the main thrusters.

01:16:55.394 --> 01:16:57.346
We're gonna spark it!
- Roger that.

01:16:57.459 --> 01:16:58.658
Depressurizing.

01:17:03.950 --> 01:17:05.172
Engines up!

01:17:34.169 --> 01:17:38.086
Hello Rom! -I've waited years.

01:17:39.236 --> 01:17:40.807
How many, how many years?

01:17:42.444 --> 01:17:47.416
By now it must be, 23
years, 4 months, 8 days.

01:17:51.166 --> 01:17:52.461
Doyle?

01:17:59.562 --> 01:18:02.914
I thought I was prepared... I
knew the theory...

01:18:02.985 --> 01:18:05.501
reality is different.

01:18:06.518 --> 01:18:07.518
And Miller?

01:18:08.678 --> 01:18:10.548
There's nothing here for us.

01:18:14.229 --> 01:18:18.077
Why didn't you sleep? -Oh I
had a couple of stretches.

01:18:18.150 --> 01:18:21.037
I stopped believing that
you were coming back.

01:18:21.116 --> 01:18:23.954
Something seemed wrong about
dreaming my life away.

01:18:24.023 --> 01:18:27.017
I learned what I could
from the black hole

01:18:27.160 --> 01:18:29.488
but I couldn't send
anything to your father.

01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:34.370
We've been receiving but nothing gets out.
- Is he alive?

01:18:34.453 --> 01:18:37.416
Oh, yeah. -Yeah? -Yeah.

01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:44.342
We've got years of messages stored.
- Cooper.

01:18:44.451 --> 01:18:47.804
Messages span 23 years.

01:18:49.420 --> 01:18:51.359
Play from the beginning.

01:18:54.732 --> 01:18:59.551
Hey Dad, Just checkin'
in, sayin' hi.

01:19:00.856 --> 01:19:04.198
Umm, finished 2nd in school,

01:19:04.308 --> 01:19:07.906
Miss Carlin's still
giving me Cs though,

01:19:08.055 --> 01:19:11.213
pulled me down, but
second's not bad.

01:19:12.364 --> 01:19:14.631
Grandpa attended the ceremony.

01:19:16.227 --> 01:19:20.709
Umm, oh, I met another girl dad.

01:19:20.752 --> 01:19:25.769
I uh, I really think
this is the one.

01:19:26.286 --> 01:19:28.901
Her name is Lois.
That's her right there.

01:19:32.575 --> 01:19:34.195
Murphy stole grandpa's car,

01:19:34.303 --> 01:19:37.971
She crashed it,
she's okay though.

01:19:38.042 --> 01:19:42.838
Hey Dad. Look at this!

01:19:42.917 --> 01:19:47.272
You're a grandpa!
His name's Jesse.

01:19:47.377 --> 01:19:52.528
I wanted to go with Coop, but
Lois says maybe next time.

01:19:52.651 --> 01:19:55.103
And Donald says he's already
got the 'great' part so,

01:19:55.176 --> 01:19:57.637
we're not to call him that.

01:20:01.870 --> 01:20:04.755
Say goodbye to Grandpa.

01:20:04.861 --> 01:20:07.815
Goodbye grandpa.

01:20:07.890 --> 01:20:09.725
Sorry, it's been a while.

01:20:10.945 --> 01:20:17.016
It's..., what with
Jesse and all...

01:20:21.466 --> 01:20:25.776
Uhh, grandpa died last week.

01:20:25.883 --> 01:20:28.548
We buried him out in the
back 40 next to mom...

01:20:28.549 --> 01:20:31.110
and Jesse.

01:20:32.490 --> 01:20:37.018
Which is where we would've buried you,
if you would've ever,... come back.

01:20:38.167 --> 01:20:40.468
Murph was there at the funeral.

01:20:41.478 --> 01:20:44.130
We don't see her that much,
but she came for that.

01:20:47.350 --> 01:20:50.067
You're not listening
to this, I know.

01:20:53.069 --> 01:20:58.606
All these messages are just,...
drifting...

01:20:58.713 --> 01:21:00.977
out there in the darkness.

01:21:01.085 --> 01:21:07.179
Lois says that, uh...
I have to let you go.

01:21:08.369 --> 01:21:09.376
And uh...

01:21:10.688 --> 01:21:11.688
so...

01:21:14.082 --> 01:21:18.026
I guess... I'll let you go.

01:21:19.076 --> 01:21:21.267
I don't know where you're dad.

01:21:21.377 --> 01:21:24.941
But I hope that you're at peace.
And...

01:21:25.052 --> 01:21:27.559
Goodbye.

01:21:39.993 --> 01:21:42.220
Hey Dad.

01:21:45.284 --> 01:21:48.202
Hey Murph. -You son of a bitch!

01:21:51.599 --> 01:21:54.899
I never made one of these when
you were still responding,

01:21:54.900 --> 01:21:56.773
because I was so mad
at you for leaving.

01:21:59.175 --> 01:22:02.013
And then when you went quiet,

01:22:04.819 --> 01:22:07.945
it felt like I should've lived
with that decision, and I have,

01:22:11.913 --> 01:22:14.525
but today is my birthday,

01:22:17.818 --> 01:22:21.562
And it's a special one,
because you told me,

01:22:24.499 --> 01:22:27.842
you once told me that
when you come back...

01:22:27.956 --> 01:22:29.869
we might be the same age.

01:22:31.569 --> 01:22:34.753
And today I'm the age
you were when you left.

01:22:37.641 --> 01:22:41.019
So it would be a real good
time for you to come back!

01:22:53.191 --> 01:22:55.660
I didn't mean to intrude,

01:22:56.596 --> 01:22:58.525
It's just that I've
never seen you in here

01:22:58.537 --> 01:23:00.748
before. -Because I've never
been in here before.

01:23:03.124 --> 01:23:07.580
I talk to Amelia, all the time.
It helps.

01:23:07.731 --> 01:23:11.803
I'm glad you've started.
- I haven't.

01:23:11.915 --> 01:23:16.282
Just had something which needed to get out.
- I know they're still out there.

01:23:16.391 --> 01:23:16.685
I know.

01:23:16.802 --> 01:23:18.875
There are so many
reasons why our

01:23:18.887 --> 01:23:21.646
communications might not
be getting through.

01:23:21.763 --> 01:23:22.944
I know Professor.

01:23:23.058 --> 01:23:27.092
I'm not sure, what
I'm more afraid of.

01:23:27.205 --> 01:23:30.200
Them never coming back or...

01:23:30.270 --> 01:23:34.351
coming back to
find we've failed.

01:23:34.464 --> 01:23:37.861
Then let's succeed. -So,

01:23:37.968 --> 01:23:42.867
back to the fourth iteration. Let's
run it through some new fields.

01:23:42.978 --> 01:23:46.558
With respect Professor, we've
tried that hundreds of times.

01:23:46.670 --> 01:23:50.189
- It only has to
work once, Murph.

01:23:53.433 --> 01:23:56.844
Every rivet that they strike
could've been a bullet.

01:23:56.921 --> 01:23:59.990
We've done well,
in the world here,

01:24:00.098 --> 01:24:04.155
whether or not we crack the
equation, before I kick the bucket.

01:24:04.268 --> 01:24:07.939
Don't be morbid Professor.
- I'm not afraid of death.

01:24:08.047 --> 01:24:09.810
I am an old physicist.

01:24:11.444 --> 01:24:13.096
I'm afraid of time.

01:24:19.732 --> 01:24:21.434
Time.

01:24:23.616 --> 01:24:25.449
You're afraid of time.

01:24:27.400 --> 01:24:30.460
For years we've been trying to solve
the equation without changing...

01:24:30.547 --> 01:24:33.139
the underlying assumption
about time. -And?

01:24:33.293 --> 01:24:37.252
What it means, is each iteration is
an attempt to prove it's own proof,

01:24:37.330 --> 01:24:41.200
it's recursive,...it's
nonsensical.

01:24:41.340 --> 01:24:45.047
Are you calling my life's
work nonsense, Murph?

01:24:46.329 --> 01:24:49.374
No, I'm saying that you've been
trying to finish it with one arm...

01:24:49.375 --> 01:24:53.190
no, with both arms
tied behind your back.

01:24:54.623 --> 01:24:56.212
And I don't understand why.

01:24:57.325 --> 01:24:59.115
I am an old man Murph.

01:24:59.224 --> 01:25:02.751
Can we take this point
up at another time?

01:25:02.862 --> 01:25:04.914
I want to talk to my daughter.

01:25:06.429 --> 01:25:09.810
Stepping out into the universe,

01:25:09.927 --> 01:25:14.050
we must confront the reality
of interstellar travel.

01:25:14.162 --> 01:25:18.296
We must reach far beyond
our own lifespans.

01:25:19.557 --> 01:25:22.304
We must think, not
as individuals,

01:25:22.416 --> 01:25:24.614
but as a species.

01:25:25.946 --> 01:25:30.937
'Do not go gentle into
that good night.'

01:25:31.486 --> 01:25:34.588
TARS kept the Endurance right
where we needed her...

01:25:34.663 --> 01:25:37.398
but the trip took years
longer than what we anticipated.

01:25:37.507 --> 01:25:40.334
We no longer have the fuel
to visit both our prospects,

01:25:40.410 --> 01:25:42.993
so, we've got to choose.

01:25:44.648 --> 01:25:45.648
But how?

01:25:46.595 --> 01:25:48.076
They're both promising.

01:25:49.378 --> 01:25:51.769
And Edmunds data is better,

01:25:51.770 --> 01:25:54.553
but Dr. Mann is the one who's
still transmitting. So...

01:25:54.663 --> 01:25:57.474
We've got no reason to suspect
Edmunds data would've soured.

01:25:58.592 --> 01:26:02.804
His world has key elements to sustain
human life. -As does Dr. Mann's.

01:26:02.877 --> 01:26:04.245
Cooper, this is my field.

01:26:05.730 --> 01:26:10.245
And I really believe Edmund's
is the better prospect. -Why?

01:26:10.358 --> 01:26:15.350
Gargantua, that's why.
Look at Miller's planet.

01:26:15.461 --> 01:26:19.654
Hydrocarbons, organics,
yes; But no life. Sterile.

01:26:19.668 --> 01:26:24.511
We'll find the same thing on Mann's.
- Because of the black hole?

01:26:24.587 --> 01:26:28.087
- Murphy's Law. Whatever
can happen, will happen.

01:26:28.195 --> 01:26:30.865
Accidents are the first
building block of evolution,

01:26:31.017 --> 01:26:34.398
but when you're orbiting a black
hole, not enough can happen,

01:26:34.513 --> 01:26:38.378
it sucks in asteroids, comets, other
events which would otherwise reach you.

01:26:38.487 --> 01:26:39.767
We need to go further afield.

01:26:40.516 --> 01:26:46.301
You once said that Dr.
Mann, was the best of us.

01:26:46.411 --> 01:26:50.058
He is remarkable. we're
only here because of him.

01:26:50.165 --> 01:26:53.440
And, and yet here he is,
he is on the ground,

01:26:53.588 --> 01:26:58.209
and he's sending a very unambiguous
message, telling us to come to his planet.

01:26:59.194 --> 01:27:03.954
- Granted. But Edmund's
data is more promising.

01:27:04.027 --> 01:27:04.967
We should vote.

01:27:04.979 --> 01:27:07.834
Well, if we're going to vote,
there's something you should know,

01:27:07.944 --> 01:27:11.447
Brand, he has a right to know.

01:27:11.521 --> 01:27:14.953
That has nothing to do with it.
- What does?

01:27:15.066 --> 01:27:18.210
She's in love with Wolf Edmunds.
- Is that true?

01:27:18.323 --> 01:27:19.545
Yes.

01:27:22.293 --> 01:27:25.460
And that makes me want
to follow my heart.

01:27:28.633 --> 01:27:32.678
Maybe we've spent too long trying
to figure all this out with theory,

01:27:32.756 --> 01:27:35.881
- You're a scientist Brand.
- So listen to me,

01:27:35.996 --> 01:27:40.640
When I say that love isn't
something we invented, it's...

01:27:40.752 --> 01:27:44.314
observable, powerful.

01:27:46.227 --> 01:27:50.933
It has to mean something. -Love has
meaning, yes, social utility...

01:27:50.934 --> 01:27:54.521
social bonding, child rearing,
- We love people who have died,

01:27:54.628 --> 01:27:58.565
where's the social utility in that?
- None.

01:27:58.676 --> 01:28:01.473
- Maybe it means something
more, something we can't...

01:28:01.546 --> 01:28:04.566
yet understand.

01:28:04.633 --> 01:28:07.977
Maybe it's, some
evidence, some...

01:28:08.855 --> 01:28:13.626
artifact of a higher dimension...
that we can't consciously perceive,

01:28:13.749 --> 01:28:16.651
I'm drawn across the
universe to someone...

01:28:16.724 --> 01:28:21.351
I haven't seen in a decade.
Who, I know, is probably dead.

01:28:21.462 --> 01:28:24.485
Love is the one thing
we're capable...

01:28:24.555 --> 01:28:27.778
of perceiving that transcends
dimensions of time and space.

01:28:29.041 --> 01:28:32.107
Maybe we should trust that,

01:28:32.178 --> 01:28:35.110
even if we can't
understand it yet.

01:28:38.591 --> 01:28:40.821
Alright Cooper,

01:28:43.238 --> 01:28:44.238
Yes!

01:28:45.687 --> 01:28:48.895
The tiniest possibility of
seeing Wolf again excites me.

01:28:49.116 --> 01:28:53.843
But that doesn't mean I'm wrong.
- Honestly Amelia,

01:28:55.757 --> 01:28:57.122
it might.

01:29:02.842 --> 01:29:06.615
TARS, chart a course for Dr.
Mann's.

01:29:22.790 --> 01:29:27.287
We'll lose about a third again.
Next year. Next year,

01:29:27.299 --> 01:29:31.891
I'm gonna work Nelson's farm
and I'm gonna make it up.

01:29:32.004 --> 01:29:33.910
What happened to Nelson?

01:29:39.708 --> 01:29:42.257
Murph, can I get you anything?
Would you like

01:29:42.269 --> 01:29:44.608
some more Soufflé? -No, I'm full.
Thanks.

01:29:44.719 --> 01:29:45.719
It was delicious.

01:29:46.987 --> 01:29:48.426
Hand me that donut please.

01:29:50.551 --> 01:29:54.993
Will you spend the night? Your room
is exactly as you left it. It's...

01:29:55.028 --> 01:29:55.910
I need to get back.

01:29:55.922 --> 01:29:58.379
My sewing machine is in
there, but there's plenty...

01:29:58.449 --> 01:30:01.454
-I need to...

01:30:02.892 --> 01:30:07.037
too many memories. -Well,
we have something for that.

01:30:15.812 --> 01:30:16.915
Dust.

01:30:18.535 --> 01:30:21.811
Lois, I have a
friend who could...

01:30:21.891 --> 01:30:24.080
look at his lungs.

01:30:42.236 --> 01:30:45.263
Amelia, I'm sorry. -You're
just being objective.

01:30:45.335 --> 01:30:48.530
Unless you're punishing me, for
screwing up on Miller's planet,

01:30:48.733 --> 01:30:50.737
- No, this wasn't a
personal decision.

01:30:50.813 --> 01:30:55.272
Well, if you're wrong, you have a
very personal decision to make.

01:30:55.383 --> 01:30:59.415
Your fuel calculations are
based on a return journey.

01:30:59.524 --> 01:31:02.464
Strike out on Mann's planet and
you'll have to decide whether...

01:31:02.539 --> 01:31:06.026
to return home, or push
onto Edmunds with plan B.

01:31:06.190 --> 01:31:09.999
Starting a colony could
save us from extinction.

01:31:10.113 --> 01:31:12.853
You might have to decide between
seeing your children again...

01:31:12.964 --> 01:31:14.901
or the future of the human race.

01:31:16.052 --> 01:31:17.973
I trust you'll be
as objective then.

01:31:24.122 --> 01:31:27.397
He has been asking for
you since he came to.

01:31:27.472 --> 01:31:28.770
We were trying to reach you.

01:31:34.461 --> 01:31:38.155
Murph? -Hey. I'm here Professor.

01:31:38.264 --> 01:31:41.644
I think I let all down.

01:31:41.758 --> 01:31:44.820
No, you got us this far.
We're close.

01:31:46.161 --> 01:31:48.399
I will finish what you started.

01:31:48.513 --> 01:31:51.630
Good, good Murph.

01:31:51.744 --> 01:31:55.938
You had faith.

01:31:56.011 --> 01:32:01.484
All those, all those years,

01:32:02.356 --> 01:32:06.483
I asked you to have faith,

01:32:07.609 --> 01:32:15.609
I wanted you to believe, that
your father,... would come back.

01:32:19.032 --> 01:32:20.903
I do Professor.

01:32:22.637 --> 01:32:26.559
Forgive me Murph. -There's
nothing to forgive.

01:32:28.467 --> 01:32:33.286
I lied Murph,

01:32:34.405 --> 01:32:36.716
I lied to you.

01:32:42.441 --> 01:32:49.399
There was no need for
him, to come back.

01:32:50.570 --> 01:32:55.786
There's no way to help us.

01:32:55.859 --> 01:32:59.193
But the Plan A? All this?

01:33:00.029 --> 01:33:04.570
All these people.
And the equation?

01:33:07.546 --> 01:33:09.881
Did my father know?

01:33:12.761 --> 01:33:15.383
Did he leave me?

01:33:18.050 --> 01:33:26.050
'Do....not....go....gentle....'

01:33:28.396 --> 01:33:34.176
No. NO!

01:33:34.294 --> 01:33:38.595
You can't leave. NO!!

01:33:38.705 --> 01:33:42.801
Dr. Brand, I'm sorry to tell you
that your father died today.

01:33:42.908 --> 01:33:46.007
He didn't feel any pain.
He was at peace.

01:33:46.087 --> 01:33:48.854
I'm very sorry for your loss.

01:34:01.439 --> 01:34:03.637
Brand did you know?

01:34:05.154 --> 01:34:07.431
He told you right?

01:34:09.032 --> 01:34:11.692
You knew?

01:34:12.743 --> 01:34:15.191
This was all a sham.

01:34:19.826 --> 01:34:21.444
You left us here.

01:34:22.782 --> 01:34:25.263
To suffocate.

01:34:26.522 --> 01:34:28.354
To starve.

01:34:55.363 --> 01:34:57.534
Frozen cloud.

01:37:21.492 --> 01:37:24.756
It's okay.

01:37:30.013 --> 01:37:33.026
It's okay.

01:37:33.144 --> 01:37:35.086
It's okay.

01:37:37.882 --> 01:37:40.167
Pray you never learn,

01:37:41.542 --> 01:37:44.522
just how good it can be
to see another face.

01:37:52.707 --> 01:37:57.997
I hadn't had a lot of hope to begin with.
After so long I had none.

01:37:59.727 --> 01:38:02.460
My supplies were
completely exhausted.

01:38:04.338 --> 01:38:08.535
The last time I went to sleep, I
didn't even set up a waking date.

01:38:12.291 --> 01:38:14.993
You've literally raised
me from the dead.

01:38:16.008 --> 01:38:17.228
Lazarus.

01:38:18.384 --> 01:38:22.372
What about the others?
- I'm afraid you're it sir.

01:38:23.385 --> 01:38:25.302
So far, surely.

01:38:25.878 --> 01:38:28.556
No. In our present situation...

01:38:28.669 --> 01:38:31.363
there's very little chance
of rescuing any others.

01:38:34.452 --> 01:38:35.873
Dr. Mann.

01:38:36.243 --> 01:38:39.508
Dr. Mann, tell us
about your world.

01:38:42.702 --> 01:38:44.757
Our world, we hope...

01:38:47.146 --> 01:38:55.146
Our world is cold, stark,
but undeniably beautiful.

01:38:58.158 --> 01:39:01.488
The days are 67
hours long, cold.

01:39:05.378 --> 01:39:09.297
The nights are 67
far colder hours.

01:39:14.302 --> 01:39:20.217
The gravity is a very, very
pleasant 80% of the Earth's.

01:39:20.331 --> 01:39:23.502
Now here, where I landed,
the water is alkali.

01:39:23.619 --> 01:39:27.316
And the air has too much ammonia in it to
breathe for more than just a few minutes.

01:39:27.317 --> 01:39:31.996
But, down at the surface,
and there is, a surface,

01:39:32.066 --> 01:39:36.643
the chlorine dissipates, the ammonia
gives way to crystalline hydrocarbons.

01:39:36.751 --> 01:39:39.486
Breathable air, to organics.

01:39:39.596 --> 01:39:42.333
Possibly even, to life.

01:39:42.414 --> 01:39:45.258
We might be sharing this world.

01:39:45.370 --> 01:39:47.654
These readings are
from the surface?

01:39:47.770 --> 01:39:52.487
Over the years, I've dropped various
probes. -How far have you explored?

01:39:52.596 --> 01:39:55.547
I have managed several major
expeditions, but with oxygen in...

01:39:55.621 --> 01:39:58.082
limited supply, KIPP
there, really did most

01:39:58.094 --> 01:40:00.567
of the legwork. -What
went wrong with him sir?

01:40:00.646 --> 01:40:03.471
Degeneration. He misidentified
the first organics...

01:40:03.472 --> 01:40:08.436
we found as ammonia crystals.
We struggled on for a time, but...

01:40:08.510 --> 01:40:10.560
ultimately I
decommissioned him, used his

01:40:10.572 --> 01:40:12.405
power source to keep
the mission going.

01:40:12.594 --> 01:40:14.603
I thought I was alone
before I even shut him

01:40:14.615 --> 01:40:16.770
down. -Would you like me
to take a look at him?

01:40:16.842 --> 01:40:20.190
No, no, needs a human touch.

01:40:20.262 --> 01:40:22.511
Dr. Brand, CASE is
relaying a message...

01:40:22.512 --> 01:40:26.800
for you, from the spaceship.
- Okay, be right there. Excuse me.

01:40:39.119 --> 01:40:42.392
Dr. Brand, I'm sorry to tell you
that your father died today.

01:40:42.505 --> 01:40:48.199
He had no pain. He was at peace.

01:40:50.516 --> 01:40:52.501
I'm sorry for your loss.

01:40:54.880 --> 01:40:59.714
Is that Murph?
- She's,...she's grown!

01:40:59.787 --> 01:41:00.798
Brand did you know?

01:41:02.206 --> 01:41:03.721
He told you right?

01:41:06.063 --> 01:41:08.073
You knew?

01:41:09.597 --> 01:41:13.851
This was all a sham.
You left us here.

01:41:15.006 --> 01:41:17.669
To suffocate.

01:41:19.370 --> 01:41:21.070
To starve.

01:41:24.777 --> 01:41:26.330
Did my father know too?

01:41:28.601 --> 01:41:29.789
Dad!

01:41:32.026 --> 01:41:37.997
I just want to know, if
you left me here to die?

01:41:39.157 --> 01:41:42.080
I just have to know!

01:41:47.197 --> 01:41:55.197
Cooper, my father dedicated his
whole life to plan A, I have...

01:41:56.009 --> 01:41:58.131
no idea what she's
talking about.

01:41:59.217 --> 01:42:00.702
I do.

01:42:05.133 --> 01:42:09.017
He, he never even hoped to get
the people off the Earth?

01:42:09.090 --> 01:42:10.708
No.

01:42:15.180 --> 01:42:18.991
But he has been trying to solve the
gravity equation for 40 years.

01:42:19.100 --> 01:42:23.312
Amelia, your father solved his
equation before I even left.

01:42:23.386 --> 01:42:25.302
Then why wouldn't he use it?

01:42:25.411 --> 01:42:29.878
The equation couldn't reconcile relativity
with quantum mechanics You need more.

01:42:29.951 --> 01:42:34.574
More? More what? -More data. You
need to see into a black hole.

01:42:34.575 --> 01:42:38.715
The laws of nature prohibit a naked
singularity. -Romilly, is that true?

01:42:39.553 --> 01:42:43.793
If the black hole is an oyster, then
the singularity is the pearl inside.

01:42:43.960 --> 01:42:46.213
The gravity is so strong
that it is always hidden...

01:42:46.286 --> 01:42:48.045
in darkness, beyond the horizon.

01:42:49.136 --> 01:42:51.366
That's why we call
it a 'black' hole.

01:42:51.475 --> 01:42:55.700
Okay,...what if we see
beyond the horizon?

01:42:55.775 --> 01:42:59.862
We can't Cooper. -There are some
things that aren't meant to be known.

01:42:59.970 --> 01:43:04.397
Your father had to find another way to
save the human race from extinction.

01:43:04.440 --> 01:43:07.964
Plan B, a colony. -But
why not tell people?

01:43:09.413 --> 01:43:10.793
Why keep it from us?

01:43:10.907 --> 01:43:13.283
Because he knew how hard it
would be to get people...

01:43:13.284 --> 01:43:18.282
to work together to save the species
instead of themselves. Or their children.

01:43:18.387 --> 01:43:19.471
Bullshit!

01:43:19.579 --> 01:43:22.324
You never would have come here unless
you believed you were gonna save them.

01:43:22.438 --> 01:43:25.198
Evolution has yet to transcend
that simple barrier.

01:43:25.272 --> 01:43:29.482
We can care deeply, selflessly
about those we know.

01:43:29.553 --> 01:43:33.911
But that empathy rarely extends beyond
our line of sight. -But the lie?

01:43:37.263 --> 01:43:41.839
That monstrous lie?
- Unforgivable.

01:43:41.951 --> 01:43:46.738
And he knew that. He was prepared
to destroy his own humanity,

01:43:46.850 --> 01:43:50.342
in order to save the species, he
made an incredible sacrifice.

01:43:50.456 --> 01:43:54.950
NO! No, an incredible
sacrifice is being made,

01:43:55.025 --> 01:43:57.929
by the people on Earth
who're gonna die!

01:43:57.936 --> 01:44:02.581
Because in his fucking arrogance,
he declared their case hopeless.

01:44:02.688 --> 01:44:07.145
I'm sorry Cooper, their
case is hopeless.

01:44:07.187 --> 01:44:11.413
No. No. -We are the future.

01:44:12.852 --> 01:44:14.073
Cooper.

01:44:15.201 --> 01:44:16.752
Cooper, what I can do?

01:44:19.635 --> 01:44:21.509
Let me go home.

01:44:22.016 --> 01:44:24.679
You're absolutely positive?

01:44:24.792 --> 01:44:29.297
His solution was correct. He's had
it for years. -It's worthless?

01:44:29.368 --> 01:44:30.999
It's half the answer.

01:44:31.585 --> 01:44:35.132
Okay, how do you
find the other half?

01:44:35.245 --> 01:44:38.384
Out there, in a black hole.
But stuck down on Earth?

01:44:38.493 --> 01:44:40.007
Yeah?

01:44:41.235 --> 01:44:42.744
I'm not sure you can.

01:44:43.689 --> 01:44:47.589
God, they just
pack up and leave.

01:44:49.208 --> 01:44:52.976
What're they hoping to find?
- Survival.

01:45:00.224 --> 01:45:01.555
Damn it!

01:45:04.623 --> 01:45:08.469
Murph, don't, don't people
have the right to know?

01:45:08.587 --> 01:45:13.010
Panic won't help. We just have
to keep working, same as ever.

01:45:13.081 --> 01:45:16.300
Yes, but isn't that exactly what
Professor Brand was manipulating...

01:45:16.408 --> 01:45:19.723
- Brand gave up on us. I'm
still trying to solve this.

01:45:20.381 --> 01:45:24.245
So, do you have an idea?

01:45:25.431 --> 01:45:26.906
A feeling.

01:45:29.427 --> 01:45:31.849
I told you about my ghost.

01:45:33.404 --> 01:45:37.952
My dad thought I called it a ghost
because I was scared of it.

01:45:42.020 --> 01:45:43.491
But I was never scared of it.

01:45:44.467 --> 01:45:52.205
I called it a ghost because
it felt....like a person,

01:45:53.969 --> 01:45:56.814
that was trying to
tell me something.

01:45:58.980 --> 01:46:02.184
If there is an answer here
on Earth, it's back there,

01:46:02.256 --> 01:46:06.502
somehow in that room.
So I have to find it.

01:46:09.890 --> 01:46:11.978
We're running out of time.

01:46:13.024 --> 01:46:16.154
What about auxiliary
oxygen scrubbers?

01:46:16.261 --> 01:46:19.922
They can stay CASE. I'll be sleeping most
of the way anyway. -Hey Coop. -Yeah?

01:46:20.030 --> 01:46:23.474
I had a suggestion for your return journey.
- What is that?

01:46:23.583 --> 01:46:25.459
Have one last crack
at the black hole.

01:46:26.767 --> 01:46:30.269
I'm going home Rom.
- Yeah I know.

01:46:30.376 --> 01:46:35.033
This isn't gonna cost you any time.
It's a chance for the people on Earth.

01:46:35.111 --> 01:46:38.877
Talk to me. -Gargantua is an
older spinning black hole.

01:46:38.985 --> 01:46:42.200
It is what we call a 'gentle'
singularity. -Gentle?

01:46:42.322 --> 01:46:46.718
They're hardly gentle. But the tidal
gravity is so quick that something...

01:46:46.825 --> 01:46:51.105
crossing the horizon fast,
might survive. A probe say.

01:46:51.177 --> 01:46:52.657
What happens after it crosses?

01:46:52.736 --> 01:46:55.618
After, the horizon, is
a complete mystery.

01:46:55.691 --> 01:46:58.487
So, what's to say that there isn't
some way that the probe can...

01:46:58.488 --> 01:47:01.412
glimpse the singularity
and relay the quantum data?

01:47:01.542 --> 01:47:05.564
If he's equipped to transmit every
form of energy that can pulse...

01:47:05.653 --> 01:47:10.508
Just when did this probe become a 'he'
professor? -TARS is the obvious candidate.

01:47:10.620 --> 01:47:13.225
I've already told him
what to look for.

01:47:13.341 --> 01:47:17.555
I'll need the old optical transmitter on
KIPP, Cooper. -You would do this for us?

01:47:17.663 --> 01:47:20.504
Before you get all teary, try
to remember that as a robot...

01:47:20.578 --> 01:47:24.190
I have to do anything you say.
- Your cue light's blinking.

01:47:24.264 --> 01:47:25.680
I'm not joking!

01:47:28.304 --> 01:47:33.029
I'm gonna need TARS to remove and
adapt some components from KIPP.

01:47:33.099 --> 01:47:36.682
Well, I don't wanna disturb his
archival functions. -I'll supervise.

01:47:36.792 --> 01:47:40.971
Alright. -Dr. Mann, we need
to find 3 secure sites.

01:47:41.051 --> 01:47:43.314
One for Brand's lab
and 2 for habitat.

01:47:43.428 --> 01:47:45.977
Once those modules have
landed, you don't wanna move.

01:47:46.077 --> 01:47:48.234
Well I can take you to the probes
sites, but I don't think this...

01:47:48.349 --> 01:47:51.263
these conditions are gonna hold.
I think we should wait.

01:47:51.374 --> 01:47:54.256
CASE is headed back down with the
rest of the distillery equipment.

01:47:54.339 --> 01:47:56.927
I would really like to secure
those sites by nightfall.

01:47:58.480 --> 01:48:02.437
Well, these squalls
do usually blow over.

01:48:02.515 --> 01:48:05.609
Okay then. -You're gonna have to
take a long-range transmitter.

01:48:05.723 --> 01:48:07.499
Right. -Are you charged? -Yeah.

01:48:07.581 --> 01:48:08.995
Follow me.

01:48:09.100 --> 01:48:13.804
TARS, 72 hours yeah?
- Roger that Cooper.

01:48:19.979 --> 01:48:23.033
Brand told me why you feel
you've got to go back.

01:48:23.847 --> 01:48:28.625
But I'd be remiss if didn't at
least mention that a mission...

01:48:28.697 --> 01:48:31.862
such as ours could certainly
do with an extra engineer.

01:48:33.322 --> 01:48:35.666
Oh you better slow down turbo.

01:48:35.778 --> 01:48:40.717
Safety first CASE, do not forget.
- Safety first Cooper.

01:48:40.795 --> 01:48:45.256
I have to tell you Dr. Mann I'm
honored to be a part of this.

01:48:45.369 --> 01:48:47.527
But once we set up
base camp and...

01:48:47.641 --> 01:48:51.992
secure those modules, my work
is done here. I'm going home.

01:48:59.829 --> 01:49:01.556
We have attachments.

01:49:01.632 --> 01:49:05.918
But even without a family, I can,
promise you that, that yearning...

01:49:06.024 --> 01:49:08.505
to be with other
people is remarkable.

01:49:08.538 --> 01:49:14.581
That emotion is, at the foundation,
of what makes us human.

01:49:23.266 --> 01:49:26.925
How long have you had that cough?
- For a while.

01:49:36.857 --> 01:49:39.156
Mom let me play in here.

01:49:39.698 --> 01:49:42.034
I don't touch your stuff.

01:50:12.500 --> 01:50:14.733
Just take this gently.

01:50:20.161 --> 01:50:23.619
You know why we couldn't just send machines
on these missions, don't you Cooper?

01:50:23.733 --> 01:50:28.709
A machine doesn't improvise well, because
you can't programme the fear of death.

01:50:28.781 --> 01:50:33.345
Our survival instinct is our single
greatest source of inspiration.

01:50:33.455 --> 01:50:35.447
Take you for example,

01:50:36.341 --> 01:50:41.499
A father, with a survival instinct
that extends to your kids.

01:50:41.622 --> 01:50:46.965
What does research tell us, is the last
thing you're gonna see, before you die?

01:50:48.408 --> 01:50:51.798
Your children. Their faces.

01:50:51.875 --> 01:50:53.867
At the moment of death,
your mind is going

01:50:53.879 --> 01:50:55.976
to push you a little bit
harder, to survive.

01:50:56.057 --> 01:50:59.642
For them.

01:51:01.737 --> 01:51:05.759
Hey, I bet you're Coop. Why don't
you have a seat here for me.

01:51:05.886 --> 01:51:08.328
It's bad. They cannot stay here.

01:51:08.687 --> 01:51:10.462
OK? -Yes.

01:51:18.230 --> 01:51:22.881
TARS, what's taking so long? -Professor,
I'm having trouble completing the boot-up.

01:51:22.992 --> 01:51:24.782
I don't understand?

01:51:31.562 --> 01:51:32.755
It's funny.

01:51:34.727 --> 01:51:39.790
When I left Earth, I thought
I was prepared to die.

01:51:40.764 --> 01:51:48.044
The truth is, I never
really, considered...

01:51:48.158 --> 01:51:50.455
the possibility that
my planet wasn't the one.

01:51:52.567 --> 01:51:56.659
Nothing turns out the way it's
supposed to be. -Let's go.

01:52:02.313 --> 01:52:04.891
Aaaaaaaaaaaah!!

01:52:13.002 --> 01:52:15.218
What is this? -What
are you doing??

01:52:15.330 --> 01:52:18.683
I'm sorry, I can't let you
leave with that ship.

01:52:18.765 --> 01:52:21.420
We're going to need it
to complete the mission.

01:52:21.530 --> 01:52:26.527
Once the others, realize what this
place isn't. We cannot survive here.

01:52:26.604 --> 01:52:28.993
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:52:38.981 --> 01:52:40.299
They can't stay here anymore.

01:52:40.373 --> 01:52:43.995
You have to leave, right now. Hey buddy,
let me make something abundantly clear...

01:52:44.071 --> 01:52:46.837
You have a responsibility.
- Shit.

01:52:46.949 --> 01:52:49.543
Coop, get her stuff,
she's goin' home.

01:52:49.653 --> 01:52:51.723
- Dad didn't raise you
to be this dumb Tom!

01:52:51.802 --> 01:52:54.099
Dad didn't raise me, grandpa
did, and he's buried...

01:52:54.100 --> 01:52:55.614
out back with mom and Jesse.

01:52:55.649 --> 01:53:03.649
All the data?

01:53:07.177 --> 01:53:12.009
No. I tried to do
my duty Cooper.

01:53:12.119 --> 01:53:16.932
But I knew, the day that I arrived
here, this place had nothing...

01:53:17.008 --> 01:53:21.289
and I resisted the
temptation, for years

01:53:21.364 --> 01:53:25.059
But, I knew that, if
I just pressed that

01:53:25.071 --> 01:53:29.320
button, then, somebody
would come and save me.

01:53:30.446 --> 01:53:33.825
You fucking coward! -Yes.

01:53:38.806 --> 01:53:40.208
Yes.

01:53:41.582 --> 01:53:43.129
Yes.

01:53:44.135 --> 01:53:45.135
Yes.

01:53:56.932 --> 01:54:01.685
Listen, if you're not gonna go, let your
family go. Just let,...save your family.

01:54:01.717 --> 01:54:06.574
And go to live underground? With you?
Pray that daddy comes to save us?

01:54:06.644 --> 01:54:10.569
Dad's not coming back. He never
was coming back. It's upto me!

01:54:10.613 --> 01:54:13.176
Are you going to save everybody?
Because dad

01:54:13.188 --> 01:54:15.477
couldn't do it? -DAD
DIDN'T EVEN TRY!!

01:54:15.597 --> 01:54:17.293
Dad just abandoned us!!

01:54:18.483 --> 01:54:22.733
He left us here to die.
- Nobody is going with you.

01:54:26.618 --> 01:54:28.822
You're gonna wait for
your next kid to die?

01:54:31.851 --> 01:54:35.745
Get out, and don't come back!

01:54:40.510 --> 01:54:42.352
Do what you want
with those things.

01:54:53.037 --> 01:54:54.740
Stop it!

01:54:56.510 --> 01:54:59.061
No. NO!

01:54:59.998 --> 01:55:03.347
Dr. Mann there's a 50-50 chance
that you're gonna kill yourselves.

01:55:03.420 --> 01:55:06.156
Those are the best odds
I've had in years!

01:55:26.209 --> 01:55:31.041
Don't judge me Cooper. You
were never tested like I was.

01:55:31.486 --> 01:55:33.414
Few men have been.

01:55:41.704 --> 01:55:43.400
You tried your best Murph.

01:55:52.209 --> 01:55:54.123
Do you feel it?

01:55:55.133 --> 01:55:57.431
The survival instinct.

01:55:58.336 --> 01:56:03.011
That's what drove me. It's what drives all
of us, and it's what's gonna save us.

01:56:03.087 --> 01:56:06.843
Because I want to save all of us.
For you Cooper.

01:56:11.963 --> 01:56:15.979
I'm sorry, I can't, I can't watch
you go through this. I'm sorry.

01:56:16.055 --> 01:56:18.324
I thought I could, but I can't.

01:56:19.589 --> 01:56:22.054
I'm here, I'm here for you.

01:56:22.161 --> 01:56:25.953
Just listen to my voice
Cooper, I'm right here.

01:56:27.078 --> 01:56:29.709
You're not alone.

01:56:38.600 --> 01:56:41.049
Do you see your children?

01:56:43.537 --> 01:56:47.661
It's okay. They are
right there with you.

01:56:51.522 --> 01:56:54.802
Did Professor Brand tell you
that poem before you left?

01:56:54.912 --> 01:56:56.606
Do you remember?

01:56:57.833 --> 01:57:02.300
'Do not go gentle,
into that good night'

01:57:02.413 --> 01:57:08.129
'Old age should burn, and
rave at close of day.'

01:57:09.470 --> 01:57:12.821
'Rage, rage against the
dying of the light.'

01:57:37.233 --> 01:57:40.127
Help! Help! -Cooper?

01:57:47.045 --> 01:57:49.864
CASE! -Brand.

01:57:50.818 --> 01:57:51.818
No air!

01:57:53.726 --> 01:57:57.174
Cooper. Cooper I'm coming.
CASE! -I have a fix.

01:57:57.256 --> 01:57:59.590
Go, go, go!!

01:58:11.341 --> 01:58:14.178
Cooper we're coming, hang
in there, don't talk!

01:58:14.251 --> 01:58:16.762
Breathe as little as possible.
We're almost there!

01:58:19.774 --> 01:58:22.244
There is a security lockout
sir, it requires...

01:58:22.326 --> 01:58:25.017
a person to access
the functions.

01:58:29.530 --> 01:58:32.784
It's all yours sir.

01:58:49.163 --> 01:58:50.163
Cooper!!

01:58:53.788 --> 01:58:56.163
Come on!

01:59:02.387 --> 01:59:06.816
I see him! I see him! To the right.
Bank right!

01:59:24.848 --> 01:59:28.107
Cooper! Cooper, I'm here.

01:59:33.653 --> 01:59:34.672
Take this!

01:59:42.514 --> 01:59:44.203
Joey bring the tankers!

01:59:50.785 --> 01:59:53.122
This data makes no sense.

02:00:00.742 --> 02:00:04.275
I'm sorry. -What?

02:00:04.390 --> 02:00:06.233
Mann, was lying!

02:00:16.014 --> 02:00:18.927
Romilly!

02:00:19.036 --> 02:00:22.324
Romilly, do you read me?
Romilly!!

02:00:22.433 --> 02:00:24.207
STEP BACK PROFESSOR!!
STEP BACK!!

02:00:31.572 --> 02:00:34.849
Romilly. -Romilly!
Do you read me?!!

02:00:37.203 --> 02:00:38.821
Keep watch!

02:00:39.973 --> 02:00:43.598
Lois! -What happened
to caution CASE?

02:00:43.676 --> 02:00:45.041
Safety first Cooper.

02:00:45.119 --> 02:00:48.860
Romilly, Romilly do you read me?
This is Brand.

02:00:51.627 --> 02:00:55.680
Romilly! -Dr. Brand, Cooper,
there's been an explosion.

02:00:55.794 --> 02:00:57.728
Dr. Mann's compound.

02:01:25.800 --> 02:01:27.562
TARS, TARS! 10 o'clock.

02:01:34.045 --> 02:01:36.006
Tell me when TARS is aboard.

02:01:39.571 --> 02:01:41.336
Romilly did not survive.

02:01:42.563 --> 02:01:46.448
I could not save him. -TARS is in.
- I'll take it from here!

02:01:46.559 --> 02:01:48.945
Do you have a fix on the Ranger?
- He is pushing into orbit.

02:01:49.058 --> 02:01:52.272
Ah, if he takes control
of that ship we're dead.

02:01:53.503 --> 02:01:56.751
He'd maroon us? -He
is marooning us!

02:01:58.084 --> 02:02:01.677
Get downstairs. Go
wait by the car.

02:02:08.397 --> 02:02:12.277
Come on. Get in the back!

02:02:12.346 --> 02:02:13.426
Get in the back seat, now!!

02:02:18.537 --> 02:02:23.222
Dr. Mann please respond! Dr.
Mann please respond!!

02:02:23.336 --> 02:02:27.333
He doesn't know the Endurance's docking
procedure. -But the autopilot does.

02:02:27.446 --> 02:02:31.220
Not since TARS disabled it!
- Nice!

02:02:31.293 --> 02:02:34.104
What is your trust setting TARS?
- Lower than yours apparently!

02:02:38.955 --> 02:02:42.024
Do not attempt docking, I
repeat do not attempt docking.

02:03:41.375 --> 02:03:44.111
Auto docking sequence withheld.

02:03:44.148 --> 02:03:48.461
Override. -Unauthorized.
- Override!

02:03:48.537 --> 02:03:50.665
Unauthorized.

02:03:55.076 --> 02:03:59.717
Do not attempt docking, I repeat Do Not!
Attempt docking! Please resp...

02:04:43.250 --> 02:04:45.163
Moving slowly towards
the Endurance.

02:05:09.451 --> 02:05:13.791
Imperfect contact. -Override!
- Hatch locked.

02:05:21.230 --> 02:05:23.649
Has he locked on yet?
- Imperfectly.

02:05:25.683 --> 02:05:27.368
Dr. Mann...

02:05:48.024 --> 02:05:50.978
Hatch lockout disengaged.

02:05:59.899 --> 02:06:03.785
Dr. Mann, do not, I repeat,
do not open the hatch.

02:06:03.858 --> 02:06:06.313
I repeat, do not open the hatch.
If you open

02:06:06.325 --> 02:06:08.628
the hatch, the airlock
will depressurize.

02:06:34.072 --> 02:06:37.087
What happens if he blows the airlock?
- Nothing good.

02:06:42.841 --> 02:06:47.128
Okay, pull back, pull back. Retro thrusters
full move back CASE! -Maximum. -Back!

02:06:47.381 --> 02:06:50.151
CASE relay my message to
the onboard computer...

02:06:50.265 --> 02:06:51.769
and have it rebroadcast
as emergency PA.

02:06:51.804 --> 02:06:57.687
Dr. Mann, do not
open the air hatch.

02:06:57.796 --> 02:07:00.098
I repeat, do not... -Brand?

02:07:00.170 --> 02:07:05.141
I don't know what he said to you? But
I'm taking command of the Endurance.

02:07:05.217 --> 02:07:07.993
And then we're gonna talk
about completing the mission.

02:07:10.512 --> 02:07:13.352
Dr. Mann, listen to me!

02:07:13.430 --> 02:07:17.315
This is not about my
life, or Cooper's life,

02:07:17.422 --> 02:07:19.194
This is about all mankind.

02:07:20.283 --> 02:07:21.313
There is a moment...

02:07:28.081 --> 02:07:29.121
It is not...

02:07:37.259 --> 02:07:38.945
Oh, my God.

02:07:56.853 --> 02:08:02.597
Cooper there's no point in using your
fuel... -Analyze the Endurance's spin.

02:08:06.674 --> 02:08:09.481
- Cooper, what are you doing?
- Docking.

02:08:12.353 --> 02:08:15.530
Computer says rotation
at 67, 68 rpm.

02:08:15.603 --> 02:08:19.747
Get ready to match our spin with the
retro thrusters. -It's not possible.

02:08:19.829 --> 02:08:21.875
-No, it's necessary.

02:08:32.953 --> 02:08:35.651
The Endurance is
entering the atmosphere.

02:08:39.879 --> 02:08:41.503
It does not have a heat shield.

02:08:43.953 --> 02:08:46.610
CASE, you ready? -Ready.

02:08:54.979 --> 02:08:57.798
Cooper, this is no
time for caution.

02:08:59.565 --> 02:09:01.581
CASE, if I pass out,
you take the stick.

02:09:01.693 --> 02:09:05.182
TARS, get ready to engage
the docking mechanism.

02:09:11.571 --> 02:09:15.011
The Endurance is starting to heat.
- 20 feet out.

02:09:15.093 --> 02:09:18.940
I need three degrees starboard Cooper.
- 10 feet out.

02:09:19.049 --> 02:09:22.581
Cooper, we are, lined up!

02:09:22.697 --> 02:09:24.093
Initiate spin!

02:10:05.997 --> 02:10:07.286
Hold on TARS!

02:10:15.099 --> 02:10:16.390
HOLD ON!

02:10:26.858 --> 02:10:30.323
We're locked Cooper. -EASING UP!

02:10:37.567 --> 02:10:39.665
Slowly.

02:10:40.692 --> 02:10:41.945
Slowly.

02:10:47.219 --> 02:10:49.160
Retro thrusters!

02:10:56.663 --> 02:10:58.948
Main engines on!

02:11:04.061 --> 02:11:07.545
We're getting out of orbit.
Come on baby!

02:11:15.121 --> 02:11:16.747
Shutting engines.

02:11:17.825 --> 02:11:19.813
Okay we're out of orbit!

02:11:27.379 --> 02:11:30.616
Okay! And for our next trick!

02:11:31.554 --> 02:11:35.703
It better be good. We're
headed into Gargantua's pull.

02:11:36.670 --> 02:11:40.213
Shit. CASE take the stick.
- Roger that.

02:12:29.345 --> 02:12:32.253
Cooper, we're slipping
towards Gargantua.

02:12:32.401 --> 02:12:34.924
Shall I use the engines?

02:12:35.036 --> 02:12:39.348
No, we gotta let her
slide as far as we can!

02:12:48.609 --> 02:12:51.433
Give it to me. -It's good
news and bad news Cooper.

02:12:51.543 --> 02:12:55.433
Yeah, to hell with it TARS!
Just give it to me straight.

02:13:03.067 --> 02:13:07.104
The back-up generator kicked in, so the
system's stable. They're all good.

02:13:08.274 --> 02:13:12.491
Good! Okay. The navigational
hub's been completely destroyed.

02:13:12.599 --> 02:13:15.216
We don't have enough life support
to make it back to Earth,

02:13:15.291 --> 02:13:19.229
but I think we can scratch over to
Edmund's planet. -What about fuel?

02:13:19.339 --> 02:13:22.042
It's not enough.
But I have a plan.

02:13:22.081 --> 02:13:25.595
We let, Gargantua,
pull us down close...

02:13:25.598 --> 02:13:28.729
to the horizon, and a
powered slingshot...

02:13:28.848 --> 02:13:31.503
around launching us towards
Edmund's planet. -Manually?

02:13:31.615 --> 02:13:35.282
That's what I'm here for. I'll take
us just inside the critical orbit.

02:13:35.357 --> 02:13:36.865
What about the time slippage?

02:13:36.979 --> 02:13:40.472
Neither one of us have time to worry
about relativity right now Dr. Brand.

02:13:45.075 --> 02:13:46.075
Sorry Cooper.

02:13:48.300 --> 02:13:51.330
Once we have gathered
enough speed...

02:13:51.402 --> 02:13:54.454
around Gargantua,
we use Lander 1,

02:13:54.953 --> 02:13:57.590
and Ranger 2 as
rocket boosters...

02:13:57.847 --> 02:14:00.512
to push us out of the
black hole's gravity

02:14:02.064 --> 02:14:04.904
The Lander's linkages
have been destroyed,

02:14:04.981 --> 02:14:07.970
so we're going to have
to control it manually.

02:14:09.447 --> 02:14:12.725
Once Lander 1 is spent,
TARS will detach...

02:14:12.834 --> 02:14:17.052
and get sucked right into that black
hole! -Why does TARS have to detach?

02:14:17.163 --> 02:14:21.651
We have to shed the weight, escape gravity.
- Newton's third law.

02:14:21.727 --> 02:14:23.829
The only way humans have
figured out of getting

02:14:23.841 --> 02:14:25.603
somewhere is to leave
something behind.

02:14:25.759 --> 02:14:30.661
Cooper, you can't ask TARS to do
this for us. -He's a robot...

02:14:30.776 --> 02:14:34.871
so you don't have to ask him to
do anything. -Cooper, you asshole!

02:14:34.943 --> 02:14:39.320
Sorry, you broke up a little bit there.
- It's what we intended Dr. Brand.

02:14:39.337 --> 02:14:42.287
It's our only chance to
save people on Earth,

02:14:42.364 --> 02:14:44.629
if I can find a way to
transmit the quantum

02:14:44.641 --> 02:14:47.126
data I'll find in there,
maybe they'll make it.

02:14:48.714 --> 02:14:51.051
Let's just hope there is
still someone there to save.

02:15:19.609 --> 02:15:21.460
Maximum velocity achieved.

02:15:21.536 --> 02:15:26.376
Prepare to fire speed thrusters.

02:15:26.449 --> 02:15:28.985
Ready? -Ready. -Ready.

02:15:29.071 --> 02:15:35.286
Main engine ignition
in 3, 2, 1...

02:15:50.974 --> 02:15:53.072
Engines of Lander
1 on my command,

02:15:53.983 --> 02:15:58.928
3, 2, 1...

02:16:03.192 --> 02:16:06.321
Engines of Ranger
2 on my command,

02:16:06.395 --> 02:16:10.956
3, 2, 1...

02:16:20.179 --> 02:16:24.136
This little maneuver is
gonna cost us 51 years!!

02:16:24.214 --> 02:16:27.528
You're not too bad for
someone pushing 120!

02:16:42.641 --> 02:16:45.815
Lander 1, prepare to
detach on my mark,

02:16:45.925 --> 02:16:51.748
3, 2, 1...

02:16:51.820 --> 02:16:52.874
Detach!

02:16:55.779 --> 02:17:00.347
Goodbye TARS! -Goodbye Dr. Brand.
See you on the other side Coop.

02:17:00.424 --> 02:17:01.768
See you there slick!

02:17:10.301 --> 02:17:13.754
Okay CASE. Nice reckless flying!

02:17:13.869 --> 02:17:16.333
Learned from the master!

02:17:16.414 --> 02:17:18.921
Ranger 2, prepare
for detachment.

02:17:19.004 --> 02:17:22.683
- What, no, no! Cooper,
Cooper, what are you doing??

02:17:22.791 --> 02:17:26.060
Newton's third law. You gotta
leave something behind!

02:17:26.429 --> 02:17:30.838
You said we had enough resources
for both of us! -We agreed Amelia,

02:17:30.873 --> 02:17:33.405
90%

02:17:33.518 --> 02:17:35.680
No!

02:17:36.959 --> 02:17:39.130
Detach.

02:17:52.513 --> 02:17:54.939
Okay, we're nosing down.

02:17:58.419 --> 02:18:00.650
Approaching the event horizon.

02:18:01.843 --> 02:18:07.815
Portside, dipping down
beneath it..., to go

02:18:07.827 --> 02:18:13.948
through it. Heading towards...
blackness... <i></i>

02:18:14.172 --> 02:18:16.044
It's all black!

02:18:18.385 --> 02:18:22.463
TARS, do you read me?
It's all black.

02:18:23.261 --> 02:18:26.122
TARS, do you read me? Over.

02:18:30.740 --> 02:18:37.070
We're... we're getting screens,
We're getting interference.

02:18:38.914 --> 02:18:40.177
Losing control of the stick.

02:18:40.281 --> 02:18:44.204
We've got flashes. Flashes
of lightness and blackness.

02:18:44.279 --> 02:18:48.983
There's a turbulence
in the gravity.

02:18:53.666 --> 02:18:56.586
Computers going down.

02:19:08.227 --> 02:19:11.459
The gravitational pull, we're
losing control of the stick.

02:19:44.465 --> 02:19:46.623
Murph! Murph, come on!

02:21:53.486 --> 02:21:54.568
Murph!

02:22:04.975 --> 02:22:07.101
Murph! Murph!! Murphhh!!

02:22:15.673 --> 02:22:16.673
Murph!!

02:22:23.464 --> 02:22:26.664
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Murphhhhhhhhh!!!!!

02:22:26.740 --> 02:22:28.148
Murphhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!

02:22:29.155 --> 02:22:30.273
No, no!!!!!!!

02:23:29.479 --> 02:23:33.435
If you're leaving just go! -No.

02:23:34.408 --> 02:23:38.163
No, don't go. Don't go you idiot!
Don't go!!!

02:23:40.543 --> 02:23:46.987
Morse, Morse, Morse.

02:23:47.107 --> 02:23:48.107
'S'

02:23:54.074 --> 02:23:55.074
'T'

02:23:58.102 --> 02:24:00.562
'A'

02:24:01.408 --> 02:24:02.580
'-'

02:24:04.464 --> 02:24:06.758
'-'

02:24:07.550 --> 02:24:11.403
Murph, we don't have
time for this, come on!

02:24:17.302 --> 02:24:18.400
STAY!!!

02:24:28.677 --> 02:24:33.716
Come on, come on,
Murph, Murph, come on!

02:24:33.728 --> 02:24:39.271
What's it say? What's it say?
What's it say?

02:24:46.477 --> 02:24:47.477
It say's STAY!

02:25:23.132 --> 02:25:25.883
Tell him Murph. Make him stay.

02:25:28.264 --> 02:25:31.069
Make him, make him stay Murph.

02:25:35.351 --> 02:25:36.897
STAY

02:25:39.650 --> 02:25:41.595
Make him stay Murph!

02:25:42.822 --> 02:25:45.409
Don't let me leave Murph!!!

02:25:48.120 --> 02:25:51.456
Don't, DON'T LET
ME LEAVE MURPH!!!

02:25:56.267 --> 02:25:58.720
NO, NO, NO, NOOO!!!

02:26:19.736 --> 02:26:21.427
It was you!!

02:26:32.602 --> 02:26:35.087
You were my ghost!!

02:26:46.697 --> 02:26:50.450
Cooper, Cooper come in. -TARS??

02:26:50.607 --> 02:26:52.041
Roger that.

02:26:53.414 --> 02:26:56.608
You survived? -Somewhere...

02:26:56.725 --> 02:27:00.935
in their fifth dimension.
They saved us!

02:27:01.052 --> 02:27:04.576
Yeah? Well who the
hell is 'They'?

02:27:04.687 --> 02:27:06.813
And just why would
they want to help us?

02:27:06.894 --> 02:27:09.979
I don't know, but they constructed
this three-dimensional space...

02:27:09.980 --> 02:27:12.313
inside their five
dimensional reality to allow

02:27:12.325 --> 02:27:14.716
you to understand it. -Yeah
well it ain't working.

02:27:14.792 --> 02:27:20.909
Yes it is. You've seen that time, is
represented as a physical dimension.

02:27:21.029 --> 02:27:25.585
You've worked out that you can exert a
force across space-time. -Gravity...

02:27:26.629 --> 02:27:29.246
to send a message?
- Affirmative.

02:27:31.187 --> 02:27:33.157
Gravity...

02:27:33.273 --> 02:27:37.731
can cross the dimensions,
including time?

02:27:38.006 --> 02:27:39.268
-Apparently.

02:27:43.056 --> 02:27:46.974
Do you have the quantum data?
- Roger, I have it.

02:27:47.084 --> 02:27:50.421
I've translated it on
all wavelengths...

02:27:50.422 --> 02:27:54.583
but nothing is getting out Cooper.
- I can do this, I can.

02:27:54.632 --> 02:27:59.266
But such complicated data to a child?
- Not just any child.

02:28:01.106 --> 02:28:02.937
Come on dad!

02:28:06.040 --> 02:28:07.736
Murph, the fire's out! Come on!

02:28:07.807 --> 02:28:09.789
Even though you communicate
it here, she won't

02:28:09.801 --> 02:28:11.498
understand it's
significance for years!

02:28:11.661 --> 02:28:16.530
No, no, I get that TARS, but we've got
to figure something out alright...

02:28:16.642 --> 02:28:19.273
or the people on Earth are gonna die!
Think, think, think!

02:28:19.546 --> 02:28:23.152
Cooper, they didn't bring
us here to change the past.

02:28:26.818 --> 02:28:31.717
Say that again. -They didn't bring
us here, to change the past.

02:28:35.929 --> 02:28:38.737
No, they didn't bring
us here at all.

02:28:43.860 --> 02:28:44.860
We brought ourselves!

02:28:53.975 --> 02:28:58.385
TARS, give me the coordinates
for NASA, in binary.

02:28:58.512 --> 02:29:00.843
In binary, roger,
translating data.

02:29:24.544 --> 02:29:27.316
It's not a ghost.

02:29:28.254 --> 02:29:32.761
It's gravity. -Don't
you get it yet TARS?

02:29:32.874 --> 02:29:34.714
I brought myself here!

02:29:35.211 --> 02:29:39.161
We're here to communicate, with
the three dimensional world!

02:29:39.698 --> 02:29:40.998
We are the bridge!

02:29:48.177 --> 02:29:51.272
I thought they chose me.

02:29:53.900 --> 02:29:57.908
But they didn't choose me, they chose her!
- For what Cooper?

02:30:00.402 --> 02:30:02.021
To save the world!

02:30:06.058 --> 02:30:10.185
All of this! In one,
little girl's bedroom.

02:30:10.297 --> 02:30:12.719
Every moment, it's
infinitely complex.

02:30:12.826 --> 02:30:15.819
They have access to
infinite time and space...

02:30:15.820 --> 02:30:17.448
but they're not
bound by anything!

02:30:17.577 --> 02:30:22.327
They can't find, a specific place in time.
They can't communicate.

02:30:22.443 --> 02:30:26.100
That's why I'm here. -I'm
here to find a way...

02:30:26.124 --> 02:30:29.256
to tell Murph, just like I
found this moment. -How Cooper?

02:30:29.372 --> 02:30:30.928
Love TARS, love!

02:30:31.040 --> 02:30:34.634
It's just like Brand said, my connection
with Murph, it is quantifiable.

02:30:34.742 --> 02:30:37.245
It is the key. -Why are we here?

02:30:38.440 --> 02:30:40.342
To find out how to tell.

02:30:42.859 --> 02:30:44.621
The watch!

02:30:47.655 --> 02:30:51.319
The watch!

02:30:53.555 --> 02:30:56.714
Encode the data in the
movement of the second hand.

02:31:00.139 --> 02:31:04.135
TARS, translate the data into
Morse and give it to me.

02:31:04.208 --> 02:31:07.565
Translating the data to Morse. Cooper,
what if she never came back for it?

02:31:08.903 --> 02:31:12.533
She will. She will.

02:31:14.153 --> 02:31:17.935
He's coming Murph!

02:31:19.052 --> 02:31:24.030
Okay, coming down!
- How do you know?

02:31:27.489 --> 02:31:29.255
Because I gave it to her!

02:31:33.902 --> 02:31:37.360
Roger Morse is dot dot dash dot,

02:31:40.206 --> 02:31:45.093
Dot, dot, dash, dot,

02:31:45.168 --> 02:31:47.405
dot, dash, dot, dot,

02:31:47.481 --> 02:31:52.161
dot, dash, dot, dot,

02:32:12.073 --> 02:32:15.995
It was him!!

02:32:16.108 --> 02:32:19.418
All the time!! I knew it!!!

02:32:19.504 --> 02:32:21.687
Dad saved us!!

02:33:04.946 --> 02:33:07.570
Eureka!!!

02:33:10.022 --> 02:33:11.930
It's traditional.

02:33:16.042 --> 02:33:17.805
Eureka!!!

02:33:22.559 --> 02:33:25.955
Did it work? -I think
it might have.

02:33:27.325 --> 02:33:28.981
How do you know?

02:33:29.061 --> 02:33:32.505
Because, the bulk beings
are closing the Tesseract.

02:33:36.333 --> 02:33:38.345
Don't you get it yet TARS?

02:33:38.418 --> 02:33:41.729
They're not beings.

02:33:41.805 --> 02:33:43.495
They're us!

02:33:45.009 --> 02:33:48.781
What I've been doing for Murph,
they've been doing for me!

02:33:48.896 --> 02:33:52.775
For all of us. -Cooper,
people couldn't build this.

02:33:52.851 --> 02:33:57.388
No, no. Not yet. But one day.

02:33:57.539 --> 02:34:01.416
Not you and me. But people.

02:34:01.488 --> 02:34:07.138
A civilization that's evolved past
the 4 dimensions that we know.

02:34:12.693 --> 02:34:13.805
What happens now?

02:35:16.773 --> 02:35:17.773
Mr. Cooper.

02:35:22.281 --> 02:35:26.069
Let's take it slow sir.
Nice and easy Mr. Cooper.

02:35:26.181 --> 02:35:28.949
Remember you're no
spring chicken anymore.

02:35:29.059 --> 02:35:31.502
Actually you are one hundred
and twenty four years old.

02:35:38.539 --> 02:35:40.155
Take it slow sir.

02:35:41.614 --> 02:35:43.128
You were, um, extremely lucky.

02:35:43.236 --> 02:35:47.513
The Rangers found you with only
minutes left in your oxygen supply.

02:35:59.516 --> 02:36:02.290
Where am I?

02:36:04.204 --> 02:36:05.787
Cooper station.

02:36:07.050 --> 02:36:08.713
Currently orbiting Saturn.

02:36:09.947 --> 02:36:12.690
Cooper station?

02:36:15.448 --> 02:36:17.887
What nice of you to
name it after me!

02:36:20.942 --> 02:36:24.526
What? -Well, the station
isn't named after you sir,

02:36:24.640 --> 02:36:26.100
It's uh, it's named
after your daughter.

02:36:26.115 --> 02:36:30.539
Although she's always maintained just how
important you were. -Is she still alive?

02:36:30.613 --> 02:36:34.477
She'll be here in a
couple of weeks.

02:36:35.567 --> 02:36:38.817
She is far too old to be transferred
from another station...

02:36:38.891 --> 02:36:41.122
but when she heard
that you'd been found.

02:36:41.229 --> 02:36:44.756
Well this is, this is Murphy
Cooper we're talking about!

02:36:44.867 --> 02:36:46.741
Yes it is!

02:36:49.222 --> 02:36:51.382
We'll have you checked out
of here in a couple of days.

02:36:54.301 --> 02:36:56.869
I'm sure you'll be excited
to see what's in store.

02:36:57.522 --> 02:37:02.396
I actually uhh, did a paper
on you, in high school,

02:37:02.504 --> 02:37:04.132
I know all about your
life back on Earth.

02:37:05.931 --> 02:37:08.632
Oh yeah, right.

02:37:10.004 --> 02:37:16.365
Sir, if you could follow me? You've
got a really good situation.

02:37:20.147 --> 02:37:23.537
So um, when I made my
suggestion to Ms. Cooper,

02:37:24.873 --> 02:37:27.817
I was delighted to hear that
she thought it was perfect.

02:37:34.438 --> 02:37:38.200
Well of course, I didn't
speak to her in person.

02:37:42.429 --> 02:37:47.313
My dad was a farmer. Like
everybody else back then.

02:37:47.422 --> 02:37:50.641
Anyway, there just
wasn't enough food.

02:37:50.753 --> 02:37:56.727
We had strips of sheet to
cover our nose and mouth.

02:37:57.021 --> 02:37:59.284
So we wouldn't breathe
so much of it.

02:38:07.025 --> 02:38:09.677
She did confirm, just how
much you loved farming.

02:38:09.758 --> 02:38:12.141
She did? Did she?

02:38:12.215 --> 02:38:15.529
Well, home sweet home!

02:38:15.601 --> 02:38:19.229
Everything is in its place
and faithfully reproduced.

02:38:19.310 --> 02:38:20.695
Yes.

02:38:25.244 --> 02:38:30.517
Hey, is this? -Oh yeah, the machine
we found out near Saturn with you.

02:38:30.630 --> 02:38:33.994
It's power source is shot, but we
can get another one if you want.

02:38:34.103 --> 02:38:35.863
Yes, please!

02:38:37.126 --> 02:38:38.126
Settings.

02:38:39.105 --> 02:38:40.105
General settings.

02:38:41.097 --> 02:38:42.280
Security settings.

02:38:44.408 --> 02:38:47.423
Honesty, new setting.

02:38:48.658 --> 02:38:53.518
95% Confirmed. Additional
customization?

02:38:53.592 --> 02:38:58.272
Humor: 75%

02:38:58.382 --> 02:38:59.935
Confirmed.

02:39:00.046 --> 02:39:04.053
Auto self-destruct
T minus 10, 9...

02:39:04.158 --> 02:39:05.740
Let's make that 60%.

02:39:07.514 --> 02:39:10.317
60% confirmed.

02:39:10.390 --> 02:39:14.138
Knock Knock. -You want 55?

02:39:18.503 --> 02:39:20.503
Is this really what it was like?

02:39:22.845 --> 02:39:25.549
It was never this clean slick.

02:39:30.270 --> 02:39:34.793
I don't care much for this, pretending
we are back where we started.

02:39:35.622 --> 02:39:37.853
I want to know where we are?

02:39:38.978 --> 02:39:41.309
Where are we going?

02:39:46.183 --> 02:39:48.645
Mr Cooper. -Yes? -The
family is all in there.

02:39:48.802 --> 02:39:50.433
Family?

02:39:50.544 --> 02:39:54.392
Yeah, they all came out to see her. She's
been in cryo sleep for almost 2 years.

02:40:27.034 --> 02:40:29.800
You told them I liked farming?

02:40:35.241 --> 02:40:36.393
It was me Murph!

02:40:38.839 --> 02:40:41.250
I was your ghost!

02:40:42.300 --> 02:40:43.774
I know.

02:40:45.901 --> 02:40:51.545
People didn't believe me, they thought
I was doing it all myself. But...

02:40:54.721 --> 02:40:57.134
I knew who it was.

02:41:01.277 --> 02:41:03.368
Nobody believed me.

02:41:03.487 --> 02:41:06.431
But I knew you'd come back.

02:41:08.234 --> 02:41:09.849
How?

02:41:11.190 --> 02:41:15.150
Because my dad promised me!

02:41:21.540 --> 02:41:25.642
I'm here now Murph. I'm here!

02:41:27.450 --> 02:41:34.894
No. No parent should have to
watch their own child die.

02:41:37.028 --> 02:41:41.166
I have my kids here for me now.

02:41:43.436 --> 02:41:45.505
You go!

02:41:48.058 --> 02:41:49.058
Where?

02:41:52.352 --> 02:41:54.479
Brand.

02:42:03.505 --> 02:42:06.299
She's, out there.

02:42:10.863 --> 02:42:13.829
Setting up camp.

02:42:40.381 --> 02:42:45.814
Alone, in a strange galaxy.

02:42:56.554 --> 02:43:00.023
Maybe right now
she's, settling in...

02:43:00.058 --> 02:43:02.378
for the long nap.

02:43:18.324 --> 02:43:22.753
By the light of our new sun.

02:43:37.669 --> 02:43:40.369
In our new home.
